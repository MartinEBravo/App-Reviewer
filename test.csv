"I’ve only been on it an hour and love it, but I accidentally clicked use my Instagram profile and now I’m not able to update my profile handle. 

I understand the ease of taking things from Instagram but people make mistakes things change. Why can’t we update our user profile in Threads? 

I wanted to import my Instagram business handle not my Instagram personal handle. 

Is this something you can fix? 🙏",1

Zuck on the rise,2
"Its like Twitter... only its called Threads. The immediate vibe that I got was that its intended to be a place for millennials to feel that sense of being cool again, like they once did when they got Facebook for the first time. The other problem is that I dont see what void its trying to fill, or what problem its trying to solve, other than being another Twitter ""killer"" that is going to solve all the perceived non existent problems of Twitter (Remember when everyone was all excited over the Facebook Killers known as either Google Plus or Diaspora?). I also don't really see how it heightens or enhances instagram, either. Instagram is for all intents, well laid out despite the fact that you cant have a chronological feed that shows you everyone you follow (which it would be nice to scroll through my followers, and not my top interactions + whatever else instagram's algorithm tosses up). Btw, thanks for not allowing me to delete Threads unless I delete my Insta, there is simply no reason for that much tie-in. Regardless now I have a silly @ like symbol on my profile that redirects to a defunct threads link, so good job for useless features. Lastly, in regards to people complaining about toxicity on Twitter as a reason for this app to exist, I would suggest that Twitter is neither toxic or pure, but that most have no clue how go actually use it, as all algorithms are a result of what you, the user, put into it.",0
Wow,2
Highly censored. Pass,0
This app is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE on my Xiaomi Redmi note 7. Hope a fix is coming soon.,0
Good,2
The fact that it forces me to see content I don't want gives it a one-star review immediately. I don't want to see any content from anyone other than the followers I have selected.,0
Worst privacy policy.. even you can not delete your own data from the account. If you create account and not like it you can not delete account and remove your data. The only way is they asked you to delete your Instagram account.,0

"So far it's been pretty OK. My feed is nothing but celebrities I do not care about at all and none of the people I follow. Seems to be no way to toggle that yet. Once that becomes a thing, I might raise my score. Having no ads (yet) has been lovely but that'll last *maybe* two days.",0
"Because Threads is part of Instagram, it shares the same TOS. This means that nudity is banned, which makes me happy. I had enough of all of the porn bots on Twitter, so Threads was the smartest option. I love just how much better this app is over Twitter.",2

"First, they are accessing precise location without consent. The app is such a twitter knock off that it is hard to use you and even harder to navigate for content you want.

Awesome experience. Infact better than Twitter.,2

Good application but option to translate instagram threads should be given please,2
"Sadly just more Meta garbage. Censoring and jailing galore as is the standard with Facebook community ""standards"". The figures quoted of all the millions of new users to the platform is completely inaccurate as 99%+ are already Instagram users so this is hardly anything to brag about NEW USERS 👎🏻 I registered a new account to test Facebook and Instagrams ""standards"" and was immediately blocked with 6 months to appeal. Total bogus rubbish built with Copy & Paste",0

"After reading “Data Linked to You” I couldn’t think of a metric they’re not collecting. Someone needs to tell Meta that “1984” was a warning and not an instruction manual.

If you loved the abuse Meta foisted of you with Facebook and Instagram through the pushing of the most inflammatory content solely to raise engagement and their emotionally manipulative advertising all the while tracking you like a parolee with a GPS ankle bracelet you’ll love Treads. Otherwise join Mastodon which doesn’t manipulate your feed, has no advertising and collects zero tracking data on its users.

Threads again shows Meta is an electronic version of cancer.",0
"I really love this app, but dear Devs, please help: I was in the zone with the bad internet, where I got an error saying that the feed cannot be loaded.

I got to enjoy the app for maybe 2 hours before it decided that it was going to crash whenever I try to reply to a thread or post my own. I can However still follow people and like post no problem. I can also respond to follow requests. But I can't use the app to share my own content which is the whole reason I downloaded it. I have seen some reviews about it doing the same thing for anyone with an Iphone 8 or lower and guess what? I have an aiphone 8. Please fix this I want to enjoy the app fully.,0

It is not bad 😏😏,1

I mean it a good platform but it's has some loops holes like you can't delete the app and once you unhide badge from profile it's never gonna come back jerks!!!!🏇 I other words it's just Elonmusk vs markzukerberg ..... So yeah enough the triffle but keep its little safe and private to perform these activites on such platform,1
Gud app,2

This app is amazing after using it I thought of uninstalling twitter 😂...This is going to be even better than Twitter I have a feeling!! Thankyou Mark Zuckerberg Sir For this new Amazing Application - Threads !!,2
"So, immediate problems: The way to choose files is unsortable and awful. Writing replies to ANY post is frustrating because the keyboard will cover it. Curating your feed is difficult at best and impossible at worst, since at first it only shows verified account's posts— except you literally can't search for topics you enjoy to interact with those and curate your algorithm. I really hope it gets better.",0

"Great app, great execution and anybody saying otherwise is just hating or a twitter agent. They do need to fix the follower issue though because I’m not able to see who individually followed me unless I’m on a private account and therefore I can’t follow anyone back without going through all my followers and searching for specific people. Notifications should work just like how instagram does",2

There should not be an option to attach media. Soon there will be a no difference in threads & instagram.,0
"Just new face behind other! 1 . Its just a new look behind insta . 2. All apps r attached to each other, fb and insta . 3. Probaby security and reporting system would be same and i am already blocked on fb and getting threats to lose my insta . So it will also be more like threats than threads. 4 . U cannot log in through google. And it cause u to make a new profile, after making it, it says passwore incorrect or user not found. 5. Alot more needs to develop. I cannot restore my fb accoun.",0

Probably the best experience I've had on a social platform since the beginning of Facebook.,2
"Okay so the first few hours were fine and I was posting my threads non stop and having fun and gained a follower. But then a after that when I opened the app again it deleted all my THREADS and said "" Sorry, something went wrong. Try again"" and I had no followers , couldn't see my threads because they got deleted and I couldn't see posts on my feed. Very disappointed 😞",0

Honestly! It's a good app but it can't be compete with Twitter because it's has very limited and so much boring features and Twitter has much Fun but hopefully it will improve in future! But now time I gave it 1 star ⭐,0

Yes the app is excellent. This app has been fantastic,2
RIP twitter & Elon Musk,2
"So far a smooth interface, but these are to be worked on; a) App has no dark theme, it bugs when you try linking with Instagram settings. b) To be more interactive, users should read quotes. c) You can't save/download media. d) Having a trend table would widen the public discourse. e) The profile page looks bland, a header should be added, then a face lift. f) When typing, my keboard covers my text. I can't see what I type. g) a DM feature should be added. h) App settings made independent.",0

Good start but the Android version needs a dark mode in the worst way.,1
Not very well application but good for time wasting. Not only this application all applications such as Instragram Twitter and all meta app are time wasting.,2

Minimalist and clean UI Design,2
"This is an Amazing app! I like how it performs, it's buttery-smooth and so fast, I wish they add couple of features to the future updates such as a following page, being able to edit Threads and DMs would be great. But overall it's a great social media app and I'm enjoying it right now.",2
It's a good app but it consumes a lot of data just like Instagram,1
Literal nadie pidio un twitter 2 😭,2
"Cut, copy, paste",2
"Muy bonito pero twitter es mejor, más seguro y más serio",1
"It's a new app so I'll give it some slack but whenever I go into my feed, it shows random people posting. Which isnt a problem, I couldn't care less but I'd prefer to see people I've followed first just like the actual Instagram. 

Leads me into my next point, I can't seem to comment or post threads. It's literally the main purpose of this app too. I've tried uninstalling it and redownloading it and refreshing my feed. Nothing works, it just keeps kicking me out everytime I try to post something. Could be something I'm only experiencing, and it's not that big of a deal because I don't post much anyways. 

Overall, its still a new app so I'm hoping these bugs will get fixed soon.",0
"Excellent Application,",2
Twitter is better Elon Musk,0
"You don’t see posts from people you follow unless you look them up every single time. Also, my feed is only far left politics. I don’t follow any sort of political stuff on any social media, and have never even googled politics. Never have, never will.

Wow Instagram have come again with ogbenge 😆 I will come back for more stars if need be🥰,1
Mine is extremely glitchy i cannot even see the screen,0
Where's the dark mode?,2
App has only one way to log in - with Instagram. This seems like just an IG byproduct. I don’t use IG so bye-bye Threads. Downloaded & deleted in less than 2 minutes.,0
I am team Elon,0
sus ahh app,2

Nobody wants to see them blue checks… the celebrities..the ai composed threads…or half naked people. We want am app truly for us people/humans. No advertising. None of it. I like the layout I guess. It truly has potential if it wasn’t in competition with Twitter and a mass distraction.,0

I would rate this much higher if I had a way to separate the people I want to see vs everyone else that’s suggested.",1
Yeah app is good but it showing some glitches in my phone .,1
"Honestly, it really does feel like Twitter, but less cursed. I've seen no real problems with it so far. One thing I think would be cool is instead of showing the little character at the bottom right of the screen to view our profile, it should be our profile picture. Not nitpicking, I just think that'd be a cool idea. Also being able to edit our comments and stuff would be cool as well. Still an amazing app, five stars well earned thus far.",2

"The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..",1

"I write this review to not only speak of the good of Threads but also to share my thoughts on how to make it better than not just Twitter, but also Facebook. 

I deleted my Twitter account years before Musk took over it, and even then I lost interest within 6 months of having it. There were so many flaws about the sheer environment of Twitter that pushed me away from using the app. The two main flaws were that of negativity and drama from every bit of content that I was seeing. Threads has great potential in being different. I was actually interested in joining it and the app had an inviting feel to it. Now here are my thoughts on where to improve when updates come…

Make the Home page/feed only show posts/content from my followers and those I chose to follow. If anything else, possibly for every 10 posts, show me a suggested post based off of my likes, reposts, and who I follow. Nobody needs/wants to see what some random company or celebrity posted, whom they did not follow or show interest in the first place. Make this app even more inviting by filling it with content the user already liked and associated with, hence their followers and likes. 
Abide by Instagram’s Community Guidelines to a tee, if not harder. A big problem that I noticed Twitter had was the sheer indecency it had in its seemingly nonexistent post guidelines. A person could post something inappropriate without any fear of their tweet being removed. Make this app average person friendly, while also making it a place for people to voice their opinions/beliefs. 
Keep Threads and Instagram separate in terms of deletion. If for some reason I want to delete Threads, I should not worry about it deleting my Instagram. 
No matter what, do not ad us to death. Ads are not inviting, and if there ever comes a time when you do allow ads, limit them to a bare minimum and at least make it content that we’ve actually shown interest in by engagement. 
Use a few concepts from Facebook in Threads. Such as, if I search up “Atlanta Braves” I can have the option to see posts, videos, groups, hashtags, or pictures about the Braves. Add that feature to the search tab in the Threads app. 
Put the home page, which as I said should all be my followers and those I follow, in chronological order. The first thing I should see is the most recent post made. 
Keep users’ private information private and not allow any such personal information about the user be infiltrated by the software or hackers. Again, make this app a secure platform for individuals to use.
Lastly, give users the ability to customize the look of their Threads display. Such as different color schemes, text font and size, and the Instagram bio link that users currently have. Give them the ability to make the app appeal to them in looks and in sharing across account platforms. 
Hope all of this helps! I don’t know if Meta will see this review, but I sure do hope that they will continue to improve upon a platform that already has great potential.",1
App is useless when I all I see is random posts from people and topics I don't know or care about. Why can't I just see people I Follow and in chronological order?,0

Five stars just because it can potentially break twitter down and send Elon Musk back to his hole.,2
"Cool interface. Nice idea. However, I'm unable to browse different locations in my phone to add a photo or video to my post. This is significant issue and a turn off",1
Allow users to register on the app without necessarily having to operate Instagram. The current model is intrusive. It hard to anonymously use your app like one does on twitter. Delink registration from Instagram. That's the primary reason why I uninstalled the app without registering. You're making it very easy to trace people,0
Please make it possible for private texts,1
Best app but no language translate future available...,2

"Bad thing is that if we delete or deactivate th thread app, automatically instagram will deactivate 👎👎",0

"Not bad! Let's not compare you with Twitter, already, as I feel Twitter is still very much ahead in the curve. With hashtags, keyword searching and trending updates round the clock and so much more. But you have the potential Threddy. Go for it! Feedback? Sure. 1. Bring (Twitter) Lists and position them in a similar way as Twitter. 2. DMs. 3. A separate 'Followers only threads' for the TL. 4. Hashtags and keyword searching (if the plan is to actually compete with Twitter).",1
It's amazing ❤️,2

Really good altenative app for twitter...the ui is good really clear to understand....but i hope that you can add the function to download the photo of the post,2
"This app is awesome already, but I do have a few suggestions. First, you should be able to like a thread when it's shared to an Instagram story, either by having it redirect to the threads app or straight from the Instagram app. Second, you gotta make it to where you can search for threads using keywords. Instagram has hashtags, so you could even let me search using those. Dodge and weave those lawsuits ! 😛🤔🧨😈",1

better than twitter + the users are so so friendly its now my fave app ig,2
I like this app a lot. There’s no stupid rules and toxic people like Twitter. The only thing I would like changed is when you are scrolling on your feed and you’re seeing people’s posts it would be nice to see posts from people you follow. I don’t mind seeing posts from people I don’t follow but I’d like to see majority of the posts on my feed from people I follow. I was recently scrolling on my Threads feed and 90% of the posts were from people I do not follow. I would like to see posts from people I follow. Other than that the app is great.,1

I love this app already!,2
Well done 👏,2
"Threads has plenty of room for improvement. Top of my list is that links should open directly in my browser, not in an embedded browser inside Threads. It'd be nice to be able to edit a newly posted thread, say within a minute. I want to be able to search threads by any word or by whatever Threads is going to call a hashtag. It's better than the bird app and will hopefully continue to improve.",1

"Nice ui, nice experience. But only problem is we can login to one account at a time. I mean there is not even account switch option. To login other account, we first have to logout from our current login and then go to Instagram switch account and then come to threads to login again. Not on the homepage or in the front but there should be account switch option in the settings.",1
"Dropping another star because my news feed is 95% influencers and crap I don’t follow on ANY platform, but for some reason you guys pushed the app out before you could get your algorithms decent. Spent the last 15 minutes muting every other account because  ya’ll can’t just give us what we want. Please make the first update to have our feed people we follow ONLY. 

Dropping a star because my Thread's feed is ALREADY filled celebrities, influencers and other pages I have no interest in and don’t follow. Please, PLEASE keep the feed to who we follow in chronological order. 

So far I like it, but I’d like to be able to hide accounts I don’t want in my feed other than by blocking or restricting. They didn’t do anything wrong, I just don’t care about them.",0

But don’t worry. I’m getting threads suggested feeds. Which has not been the biggest hit. Again, wouldn’t be a big deal if I could better curate my list. Right now, I’m annoyed.",1
I think it's way more better than twitter,2
"so far, so good. there are still missing features in the app like DMs, camera, etc. (also the algo seems way off) but one thing i find disappointing is the dark mode feature. i've navigated the app to find the button to turn it on or off and sadly there isn't one. my phone (samsung android 9) has a theme on so it cannot turn to dark mode and it doesn't make apps turn to dark mode. please, please, please add a dark mode feature as it may help other users like me browse more comfortably!",1

"Experienced a bug that made the app unusable, while scrolling the previous content continues to stay on the screen, not allowing me to see anything. Hopefully this bug gets fixed soon",1
Soon this app will be infiltrated with twitter “Stan’s” and down the garbage it will go. Especially Arianators. The worst of its kind.,0
App is crushing while posting a thread with photo. Besides it uses more phone ram & lag the whole device.,0
"Meta are upset with the way Twitter is returning free speech, so they have decided to create a similar app that's sensor information the way they want. Garbage",0
That's a best platform to be connected with your own Instagram and use Twitter as well😉😂,2
Don't have Instagram. Don't want Instagram.,0
The app is buggy. It closes by itself when i try to open the replies,0
Bad app,0
"Go Mark, Go🔥",2
I love this app,2
Good 👍👍👍👍👍,2
"A great first experience considering that it's a v1 app. thing to improve, app crashes are frequent, looks a little weird on large screens (tablets), and a lot of missing features. what makes it special tho is that it kinda reminded me of the first few years of Twitter.",1
I have experience blurnes in my phone... Whenever I open the app i can't acess it... So here sending a bad experience...,0
"Didn't care for Twitter, don't care for this either. I didn't understand what it was based off the description and no tutorial upon downloading.",0
Good food overall but the service was lacking. Once i got to the fifth chapter the storyline began to crumble. The characterization of Spongebob was beautiful in the fact that there were so many plot twists. When he turned on Patrick in chapter 17 when he lets a boat crush him. But all in all the storyline held up and the soundtrack was made better by Yeat and Morgan Wallen,2
"Damn, so many permission",0
The app does NOT work on androids. I reported a billion times and they have done NOTHING to solve thr issues. So I cannot use the app. So twitter it is,0
This is not good 💯,0

This is worst.. I downloaded for the first time(ofc) and it is showing a glitch and not working properly... I keep on refreshing it but it doesn't work and shows the same glitch over and over...,0
I just found a much better alternative to both Twitter AND Threads. Everyone needs to download Tiblur. It's on the Google Play store. It allows media and lets the users have more say than all these promoted brands.,0

Add a draft feature. Add a dm feature. Add a VN sharing feature.....And this app will be ready to compete with twitter but until then Twitter is far better,1
the algorithm sucks. why do i have to read a thread from people i haven't followed?,0

"One of the standout features of the Thread app is its user interface. It is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The design is aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on simplicity, which makes using the app a pleasant experience.

After 1 week use of threads app I found its not good because as per meta description there is no option for personal chat through inbox direct message. I still waiting for DM direct message features. I am getting regular many followers but I didn't talk anyone's person. So I would like to request you meta team please find the problem of direct message features and try to solve as soon as possible. 🙏🙏🙏,0
Amazing app,2

That's not working in my phone,0
If you needed proof meta needs to have anti trust laws enforcement here it is ... Already have several weird stalkers on my account trying.... Already have people I don't know in my business.....already feel blocked by the racist mainstream no affirmative action at threads...breeding ground for ai copyright infringement...not art friendly... Tones of ai white supremacists.... Turning woke humans into zombies drones with algorithms for 🧠....,0
Yet to be amazed,2

Recently joined this app. App is still in the development stages and many things are missing. However. I absolutely loved the competing app before new owner tore it apart. I think Meta owner and his Executive have potential to tear ceiling off that and may have learned something from competing owner's recent failed experiences. I have much hope for Threads!,2
Smooth sailing… For now lol.,2
Far better than Twitter,2
"Absolutely love it , Meta killed it and very easy to use.",2

Greate app with good features and also fast but want I don't like about the app is that when you want to comment on a post the comment box will be under the keyboard and will will restrict you from seeing what you are typing. Hope it will be resolved,1

Nice app,2
Don't create new account and password I want to make for safe with password please why don't help me koo,0
This is a useful app,2
"I made the jump to threads on the premise I would be able to follow the folks I already follow on IG.  Why is it that this app keeps suggesting accounts I’ve already click to follow.

These suggestions aren’t new ones. It’s the same accounts over and over. It’s like it’s seems to forget as soon as I close the app. 

Please fix it asap.",1
This application haven't any search bar 😒,1
I am unable to log in. Instagram password not matching,2
I think it's a great app. I think the best thing about it is that there's no direct messaging and at least right now no ads. Right now give it a try. I think you will be happy with it.,2
It is really threading,2
"The app is glitching, I reinstalled it multiple times but still the same",0
Its good,1
I think twitter is for reliable and easy to use. Threads only display the posts of followed people's.,1

Yupp ohh,1
I have two accounts and been going back and forth logging in and out of both accounts. I guess the app thought I was a bit and blocked me or something. I can’t sign in anymore. Help please!,1
"I like this app. It reminds me of old Twitter before the Muskrat took over. I hope it succeeds. A few things, I hope they implement ""Save Photo/Video"" natively—also, a translation button and maybe even gifs. I don’t care for DMS. You could use the IG app for that. I still won’t use FaceBook, though ❤️",1
Worst app ever. An immature copy of Twitter. All social media apps by meta depresses me.,0

Instagram and Threads run on iPad but look unprofessional. Check out what some other devs are doing for the bigger screen - including twitter - for good interface ideas.,1
Great App 👍,2
boleh la.,1
Super 👍 ek number,2
Dropping review using little bit of Threads hope it can never share our personal information like Instagram and Facebook,1
I think this app beets twiter,2
Not enough features yet..,1
"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THREADS!!! Once you create an account with threads you are not able to delete just threads but you will be prompted to delete your Instagram account. Additionally, hashtagging topics or items does not work. Wait to sign up until it is a viable platform as of right now it's not worth it.",0

Very similar to Instagram and Facebook can't beat twitter I think who will download the app is the same of people who have Instagram and Facebook only,0
"It's showing some weird glitch effect, tried installing multiple times, after opening the app n scrolling the text is glitch n it just looks like a very low fps video, waste of data",0
Wonderful app.,2
This application should not exist. Users should have the option to delete their account without deleting their Instagram account.,0
Too much bugs and glitches.want to upload pic but there is no option here .,0
1.No hashtags 2.Unable to 📌 pin the threads ➿ on top . But one thing I like no limit on content or letters on a thread ➿ Good 👍.,1
Stealing is meta main job,0
"It's buggy, full of bugs and posting failed continuously, also app crashes on my high end processor phone.",0
Ok ok,1
Reviews are being deleted. Data and privacy issues. Major ones. Your information is not safe. Nor are your rights.,0
If you just make an account to check it out you can not delete it.,0

It's good 👍,2
Okay Here We Go!! Let's Do This!!,2
"It's just too random with no control over who's post pops up on feed, kills the purpose of following/unfollowing folks. In a way, it's worse than seeing ads. It'd be usable if we could limit main feed posts to only the ones who we follow and then a separate explore/Activity section.",0
Annoying with the showing of thread from people that I didn't follow and didn't know who they are. Can you just please showing thread from people that I follow?,0
It disabled my Instagram account,0

First to review- Well I think it's definitely better than twitter,2
"The app looks clean and streamlined, but scrolling quickly turns to chaos. It’s too difficult to find posts from people you actually follow, and the lack of a chronological timeline keeps me from using it more as it functions more like a news aggregator that only needs be be checked on once or twice per day.",0
I personally don't trust any of Zuckerberg's products in terms of security and others. Thank You,0
"It’s a great app, I’m loving it so far!",2
Imagine downloading this app because “eLoN RuInEd TwItTeR” lol,0

I can't open my instagram apps if my account is connected to this app,1
Excellent app. But try to make media autoplay optional. It consume lots of data.,2

"I like the app, however there are some glitches and recommendations I have. For one, the reply function seems to be finicky, it on occasion force shuts down the app when I am trying to reply to a post (a thread?). Another recommendation is discoverability, I would love a tab where you can discover new people and what they're saying. Like a community or discover page, also a trending tab with news and the sorts would boost engagement.",1

This is totally wrong.. We don't get equal Opportunity in threads.

That not correct and equal competition for the new users who want to grow on thread. Please make change in this and give equal opportunity to all the users on threads platform. Thanks,0
The screen kept frozen.,0

"Okay, it's impressive. I use Tw because it's more comfortable than Instagram because it much give us a text than a picture. Where picture is the reason why Instagram is more being used by children which it makes me uncomfortable with them. But now, there is Threads for Ig user, so I would like to choose it.",2
Khobz!,2
Interesting app and so much potential. Love that it links to your old Instagram profile. Meta should add cross sharing posts from insta to threads and also easy switching between your different Threading accounts eg personal profile and business profiles,1
Worst app,0
This app is very useful,2
Copier from elon mask coller,2
Better than Twitter,2
Good app,2

"App has been out for less than 24 hours and already has a porn bit problem. Within 14 minutes of me making my account I had 4 bots following me, and so far 13/14 of my followers are bots (account has been up for less than 10 hours)",0
Perfect,1
Twitter better than Tread *musk😞,2
Great job Mr. Mark,2
The app is randomly crashing when attaching a photo,0
"Threads is great. And I know there is more to come. Personally, one of my favorite things about Threads is the total absence of ads as I scroll. If this is the future of social media and Threads, the sky is the limit for this app. Annoying ads really are a buzzkill as you scroll. Threads is amazing without them. Plus the community on Threads right now is such a vibe and so positive. I’m rooting for Threads to keep growing. It’s got huge potential. Let’s go!",2
Make this app part of Instagram in one app and also make this app to rotate because we need to rotate,1
"The app is good, but my only suggestion is to add a 2nd feed of only the people you follow. You could follow 100 people and you feed is still 90% random accounts you never heard of. The ability to set accounts as “close friends” like instagram would be nice too",1
I posted so many post.😔 but didn't even get a like.😔 And not reached also.😔,0
Wow,2
"just fr, lol",1
"the potential is there, but i don’t want to see posts on my feed from people i don’t follow. there should be a separate recommended tab. i also wish it could be integrated into the instagram app itself, rather than having to switch back and forth (tho i do appreciate it can be done in app)",0
I don't know what is this but I like this app,2
"Basic features work as expected. But it's about time we get a big update with more complex features like Edit Thread, Translate Thread, Ability to pin Threads, better Feed page, video player optimization and working hastagd. A trending page would be nice too. But current app is very good. 4/5.",1
💸,2
Good,2
Firstly I want to say that this Platform is too much Useful and Advance with all the new features and I Love meta ❤️,2
Great at the startup...and still doing greater,2
best apppppp,2
"Good, but we should get an option to turn off recommended threads cause we don't care about a lot of these content creators.",0
Thread,2
Okay I gave 5 stars to it because I have twitter so it's my opinion,2
Theek hai,2
"Threads is so refreshing, it’s what Twitter used to be, Thank God. I see lots of positive posts and it’s so nice not having Elon on there pushing conspiracy theories. That feels refreshing and I hope it stays this way Facebook Facebook started as a great social community and meta-ruined it pushing you into negative conversations. I’m hoping threads stays away from that and is a more positive environment to communicate in but I won’t hold my breath. Hopefully they figure a way to keep out the bots and fake accounts.",2
Nice 🤙😼,2
No more,1
This is way better and easier to use than twitter,2
Is this threads app safe or not Social media talking about thread pls uninstall the app if don't uninstall u r instagram was deleted 🥲,2

If you copy something at least make it better than the original. This is utter rubbish,0
"As soon I opened the Application, it started acting like weird.",0
Very glitchy first experience. While scrolling all the text leaves a trail of itsself and doesnt get refreshed. So it's hard to scroll and read.,0

DAY 1 BABYYYYYYYY 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🎉,2
App has been glitching since I installed it,0
Complete disaster. On top of that it doesn't let you take it off of your phone because IG might go too. Doesn't let me upload some pictures and I sent notification 2 times and nothing.,0
it doesn't work properly everytime i scroll the text will be doubled and overlap to eachother,0
We will get together,2

Twitter with even more censorship.,0
Helllo,2

Wow it's great effort by Brother Mark Zuckerberg,2
i think y’all should add a section where we can sort our followers/following threads. also when i click my following it’s hard to see who i don’t follow back,2

Not good. You just doing copy paste of Twitter layout. do something new if you have otherwise don't waste your time and money.,0
Good Competitor to Twitter,2
Create new account option is bugged. Could not create a new user name and now the app doesn't even provide the option to create a new account. #day1fail,0
Cheap copy and we all know,0
Good 😊,2
Little brother of Instagram 😂 But quite good.,0
Love it so far. Can we get the search through your followers tab like on IG? Would definitely help weed through the bots/inactive users. Also I wish this app told me who recently followed me individually. They just clump errbody together so I can’t tell!,1
Mine keeps having the glitch i don't know why what's happening??,0

"I tried to like it, but it's just terrible.",0
Worst app ever. They just deleted my fan account & there are so many other fan account which is still there. They just want to have monopoly on the internet. Worst app ever.,0
I like ❤️,2
"the application looks nice from the outside and from the inside, but there are some hiccups you have in it, such as it doesn't have personal conversations, Twitter and Instagram And I searched for a theme in black when I find until now that it has another theme other than the white color and this does not suit people's thinking most of the time Dear Mark, Verify my personal account on Threads for free and you will be very grateful because I do not have the Enough money verify it by myself Thanks",2
Improvement : 1.Data Saver 2.Location wise content 3.Trending topic 4.Hastag 5. Edit button 6.Direct Message 7.Suggestion of who or what to follow,0
No one wants censorship on peoples thoughts,0
I give this app 3 stars and I gave Twitter 3 stars. The remaining 2 stars will be awarded to the victor of the cage fight and awarded the best text based social media platform. May the odds be ever in their favor.,1
Good one,1
Like the concept so far … looks like the biggest group,2
It's amazing 🤩,2
Needs some more years to be perfect.,0
Hay Everyone First time we see A beg Fight among #Elone Vs Zuck But you don't mind its a part of game .,0
Overall better than Twitter It's missing a couple of minor features that make Twitter a little bit better like your header but past that it's basically the same but better because elon's ruined the Twitter platform. Apparently there's some bugs that you should be aware of if you go installing this. I haven't experienced one.,2
O The tension of the poor is just sweet 😂🔥,2

Hey instagram I don't able to use this app on my Redmi 6 there is a killer glitch please solve this,0
Great interface. Love the seamless integration with Instagram. It’s the better version of Twitter we didn’t know we needed but now have,2
A lot of crashes,0
Why I’m being forced to have an instagram account?,0
Horrible app horrible interface generally bad.,0
"App only, no desktop, limited searches (very limited), and I don’t really get the point of its existence except to say “tWiTtEr KiLlEr”.",0
"Nothing special, just an imposter of Twitter",0
Much better than Twitter!,2
"This is very alternative for the blue bird app. It's actually fun and less toxic but there's some features that are still missing 1. Following Tab, as much as I like seeing people's threads, I wanna see the one I followed. 2. Hashtags, I mean if you wanna trend something you gotta use that. 3. Trending, I'm sorry I'm so used to looking at what's the trends ATM 4. Functional Search button. Not only the person you can search but pretty much everything",2
"I believe after giving permission to mobile gallery, your gallery folders should be grouped as it is in your gallery. It's extremely hard to select contents.",1
Best apps more than Twitter or other social media,2
Fake twitter,0
"This is going to destroy musk, i can smell it",2
Twitter was always great for it’s simplicity but since Elon took it over it seems to be getting more and more about the subscriptions. I know that this has subscriptions as well but it seems much cleaner and minimalist which I can appreciate. I’ve posted a few things so far which were easy and quick.,2
"Been in the app for 30 seconds, my feed is full of blue checkmarks that I don’t follow and can’t seem to unfollow. Refreshed my feed and saw an obvious scam. This app has been live for what, an hour? 

Why is it so hard to only show the people I want to follow in my feed?",0
Supper aps,2
Why the hell am I seeing people I don't follow? they shouldn't even be in my feed if Im not following them.,0
I woulda went four stars but there is someone with a copycat app. Threads is a good app. Better than Twitter in a few ways. Twitter is garbage now. Im Threading exclusively. More streamlined. Simpler.,2
Very nice,2
So far ' I like this application ❤️ Ab m ispe bhi reel dalunga 🤣😅 Thread ko reel m BDL dunga🖕😁,2
"Hastags doesn't work, what about trending topics?",0
"I'm still learning why I need the app & how I can make it work for me... Haven't found my identity yet... However... Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked out",0
Where's following option? How will i know whom I'm following.,0
Good,1
Laggy as hell. I don't understand why i should use a app that is worse then twitter AND steals my info,0
is good,2
Love you bestie 💖😘,2
"I think I'm the First Indian to Review it, it was cool at First but backspacing doesn't work (in mid sentence) properly if you are posting something, it stopped working I don't know why, can't say much about it, it automatically navigated through my insta profile and thread profile, I think the Server was not ready for such response from user, it has potential.",1
Great competitor for Twitter but to make it surpass twitter it has to give you the option to only see Threads from people you follow ... Don't want to see recommended Threads all over my homepage,1
I Like This App more than all this tipe apps,2
Very easy to use better than twitter you can share with any one and you log in with your instagram you open the app and you see your account on instagram you click it and you just log in and when you open on you instagram profile you see threads picture and anumber behind it the number is your turn of installing threads easist and best app in 2023,2
"it's good, but, no setting to turn off video autoplay(I really hate this), no option to save a photo, I really hope that threads will just like a twitter, but with no elon on it...",0
I accidentally hid the badge from my Instagram page and I can’t seem to put it back on my bio. Plz fix that,1

Would've been fine except the forced algorithmic timeline (which basically shows the follows of your follows and none of your own follows) basically ruins the entire app,0
It is just copy of twitter with insta filter,0

"I cannot see how this app can be considered a viable alternative to Twitter, when one must have an Instagram account in order to sign up. Not everyone possesses an Instagram account for a variety of reasons. While Twitter has become a terrible site due to its change in ownership, anyone and everyone has the ability to sign up for an account, should they feel desperate enough to do so. Denying interested potential users the ability to sign up with Threads, simply because they don’t have an Instagram account, is not a particularly business savvy move.",0

There should be a feed that only shows your subscriptions but nope, there's one feed and it shows everyone and you can't filter out content you don't like.

It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,1

Realy good idea for Meta 👌,1
Forcing us to use the app i just installed and it links my account to my main insta account and now I can't delink Or not even remove the thread id from my insta bio and can only deactivate the thread id. Worst way for promoting an app.,0

"Basically the title, would rate higher if like anyone else made this",0
Glitches out at random moments and you have to reload the app. Maybe once it progresses it'll stabilise. Urgent need of a translate option. Also the option of saving a thread would be nice. Also pining threads would be a step in the right direction.,1
I Used This App MY Experience is Too Good,2
Too many applications for the same company will somehow lead to bankruptcy.,0

Why am I seeing feeds from others that I don’t follow?,0
Threads are very slow to load. Please fix. And please add edit button.,1
Allow users to dissociate their account from Threads. It's very cunning to only allow users to delete their threads account if they agree to delete their Instagram along.,0
"This is simply another data mining app. Facebook is scraping all the additional content people are sharing here that they would otherwise be sharing on Twitter for their AI. 

Also you cannot fully delete your data without deleting your entire Instagram. 

Their plan is bait & switch, just like they did with everything else. 

Tread lightly.",0

This app will not cultivate a real culture in its current form. Even the influencers themselves are complaining. Draconian Meta content rules still apply.",0

"Threads is an interesting app with potential. It's sad how we can't add back the Threads badge to Instagram after removing it. We're also still missing basic features, such as the (1) tab to view only threads from those we follow, (2) ability to search up topics or we're interested in, and (3) privacy functions to hide those we follow and/or those that follow us. Other social media apps have these basic features! It'd be interesting to see more forum-like aspects incorporated on it. After all, forums and other discussion boards have Threads! I'm hoping topics will be organized and clearly presented (or easily found)..",1

"Thought it would be a good twitter alternative, but I was wrong. This app doesn’t cater to what and who I want to follow. It only shows me celebrities and people that I don’t know or care about. 
 Not to mention it inspires people to block each other so it’s a heavily cancel culture/censorship medium. You will be blocked if you say anything against the politically correct opinion/narrative. 

 If you think for yourself this app is not for you!

"I think it is great but some features needs to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easly. For example if you are in threads you can have switcheable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etc",1
The only reason I'm giving it a three star is because when you follow people they don't show up on your feed it's a bunch of random users other than that the app itself is pretty cool,1

I don’t want to see ads and bots everywhere like on Facebook & Instagram 🙄. I’d like to see more UI changes, everything seems small. Not compressed but the font & profile pics, names and three dots to mute/block/report is kinda on the small side and very easy to misclick. Is there an algorithm? Will there be “based on what you like”? Will we be able to switch accounts like on Instagram just by double tapping the profile tab? Will we get a following tab, so we don’t have to weed through random threads? Will we be able to have muted & blocked accounts carry over to our Thread account? If I mute someone why am I still able to see their replies in others threads?",1

"THE AMOUNT OF CENSORSHIP IS RIDICULOUS. I'm open to trying new apps and was genuinely curious about this one. However, it's like a Facebook-Jail / Twitter wannabe. The feed shows you mostly people who you DON'T follow. (Like political people that you don't care to hear about.) Threads suppresses free speech and violates your rights to express yourself. If you have an opposing opinion, you WILL be censored. Insane. Worthless useless app.",0
Lots of people post cringe things. Twitter better,0
Crash àpp Not working properly,0
A cool alternative for Twitter... Hope it will perform better than that 💐👍,2

The best to enter to the Nft,2
I'll give it a 4 rating Good features Unique interms of censorship.. Suggestions 1. Let people that Follow you be visible Alone. 2. Need to also give opportunity to edit name without changing it from instagram.,1

"Good Twitter alternative, but at the moment the app crashes whenever I post HD images",1

The number one reason this app is getting 1 star is because the company behind this app will censor anything they do not agree with. Maybe they should promote this app in china.,0

Nice,2
Too many pictures on the feed very very few actual threads,0
idk,2
Well no wonder its called twitter killer it is an amazing app,2
I don't know how this is a possible but I'm the only review on this I feel like this app is flawed I don't really get what is going for it's supposed to be a Twitter alternative but the UI is weird you don't see who you're following on your main timeline or whatever they want to call it It only shows you followers not who you're following I can say a lot more but I'm only one person in my personal opinion I think this app is very flawed for now,0
"My insta account has been crashed after downloading the threads from Instagram app. Waste of time, Twitter is best instead. I had worst experience with this app.",0

Awesome app,2
"Its like all the worst parts of both platforms, all in one app. The only feed you get is algorithm based, so you end up seeing a bunch of people you don’t know and don’t care about. I spent so long blocking people just to get passed all the corporate accounts and celebs. Instagram has a similar algorithm and its a big reason why I rarely use it. 
There’s no TAGS. You can look up specific users and that’s it. No way of finding other people, it’s just whatever the algorithm feeds you- which will be mostly blue checks trying to get in your good graces so you buy their crap or whatever. Everyone is posting about how great the app is, but it feels so fake. Like are they even using the same app?",0

Não tem filtro para poder escolher de quem que tu quer ver as coisas, não tem como ver só de quem tu segue e toda hora aparece uma postagem de algum comunista falando bobagem. Na prática, é um lixo de app. Não tem como excluir a conta depois de criar, totalmente em desacordo com a LGPD",0
It's disorganized and u can't even see posts from who u follow on ur feed. Also theirs no way to filter content on ur feed. The mute and block r ok buts it needs more filter options.if I could I'd give it 0 stars,0

Am the first to write a review on Mark Zuckerberg new app...wow😂😂 I had early access to it in the last few day and I think its great. When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish....or u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractive,2

"Retarded, you can't search for anything by keyword or #Tag. It shows only accounts!",0
Absolutely wonderful,2
This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.,0
Awesome,2
It's bad it needs more repairs 👎,0
Amazing app better than Twitter. I'm using Twitter for 10 years but not active on it but in thread I used just 1 hour and become addicted. So cool 😎,2

Got app but it kept closing and refused me to set up an account no mater what I tried the app flagged me and that made no sense! I found another way and off I was made one post will wait and see if it gets noticed. As far as Facebook I don't use it much but probably more than I with threads will wait and see if they actually flag me for my one post ? Surprise surprise I finally decided to do a thread post and bam it never posted I didn't like Facebook much hate Twitter being run by Elon Musk.,0
good,2
No trending option in threads,0
Need to improve media support. You cannot copy paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well.,0

"These are the some parts of instagram's features, then why should i use this ?",0
Wow,2
It crashes a lot i hope they can fix it,0
Pls try again ( copy & paste didn’t worked),0
The app still needs work. All I see on my home page are blue checkmarks and random influencers and brands I am not interested in. It gives the vibe being a twitter only for brands not a place for normal people. It would be great if posts were in chronological order and only see the people I follow and to include a trending page. With all the issues twitter is facing this app is still far from being a twitter replacement.,0
This app is best in twiter nice aap,2

"The Meta format arguably is by far a superior product. A social dynamic networking tool, engaging & interactively emersing both the very Ultimate in Social Media. With the Cutting Edge Evolutionary future of notoriety & symbolism in a world it stands alone.",2
Very bad interface,0

Very bad app nothing interesting lite version of twitter,0
"Downloaded, tried it, it’s the tired same ol’ same ol’. Might as well join a legit mastodon instance and skip the corporate bull if you’re interested in an alternative to the dirty bird.",0
It's an amazing app,2

दुनिया का सबसे घटिया अप्प है,0
Superb App धागा ये टूटे ना ये धागा......,1
Irrelevant since twitter is much more mature and protects free speech,0
Cool,2
"Your notification system really needs to be improved. I clicked the bell for some account but it doesn't change anything, I always miss their updates.",0
There's no option to delete my account why ?,0
Let's embark this thread journey,0
It's awesome app.,2
Only downside is seeing too many posts from people I don't follow so the ones I follow are getting a bit lost.,0
Overall I love the app. However.... I have not been able to follow new people or follow back any of my new followers for over 3 days now and I can not get anyone to help with this issue. Ive even tried to become verified but guess what can't do that either. This is very very frustrating!!!!! 3 stars because of this issue could be 5 if someone from support could help me out.** 5 days now so I'm going to start dropping the stars.,0
Going to start thread and probably first to live a review as today it has just launched 😃,2
Trash,0
"Very much good 👍 Then compare to Twitter every one can use this without any limitations 🙏🏻 but having more features like background pic before DP on profile & thus making/showing the category such as artist, actor, visual art, so on. One thing having story option on both insta.or threads",2
Good,2
Nice it will grow,2
I want translate thread function in app. I can't understand threads of other languages,1
Just unnecessary appendage to Instagram. I want a real alternative to Twitter. This definitely isn’t it. Facebook just wants to lord over your entire life.,0
ayos lang,1
I don't have Instagram so I can't try it out.,0
Not worth to try.,0
Seems like a good competitor for Twitter.,2
Good,2
Asks for instagram account. Insta-uninstall.,0
The app has some bugs it is slow and laggy,0
"It's nice App, but you need to bring direct message feature please.",1
This is garbage 🗑,0
I tried to deactivate my account on threads but the badge on ny Instagram won't go even after removing it,0
Best,2
"Chronological, please!",1
Convenient and easy to use. Amazing app. I like it..,2
🤣🤣🤣🤣,2

Total full to copy of Twitter and I know this will fail soon and you will have to close this application for ever sooner than later.,0
But the same and grandpa and grandma and grandpa and grandma and grandpa and,2
Good Apps,1
Very bad app,0
Dont know what this app is worth,0
New app from mark jukarbarg💀..ok let's try🙂,2
"Need to have an Instagram account which I don't have and no option make make an account for just this, so I gave up and uninstalled immediately.",0
"It looks fun, and was, until everything stopped loading and then the app made me unfollow about 40 people from my Instagram",0
"After a week of use, the app has gone stale. There’s not much to do on here. Whatever you can do can be done on other apps that offer far more to the user.",1
Every time I try uploading a picture the app crashes,0
Very good app,2
"The app is good and all but I can't seem to post a new thread, anytime I try I get this notification ""your thread failed to upload "" please fix it for me",1
"It's f**king insane. Btw better then twitter but it doesn't have features like vote and many others like twitter have, and we need it here too.",2
Best App,2
App is crashing as soon as I try to operate with flashlights effect 🥴,0
I love the threads concept it’s really cool. You can actually go through and see the timeline of who posted with the lines on the left of the screen. Not to mention you can see who’s in the conversation on the bottom left hand corner on the post. Keep this up looking forward to seeing something Better.,2
"It's glitching like hell, I can't even TRY the app, cause as soon as I open it it's just A COMPLETE GLITCH",0
Aliiii,2
"It's basically a Twitter clone with PG on, nothing special about Threads tbh",0
"Meh. I never wanted my ""twitter"" life and Instagram to be the same place. Plus I can't delete my account without deleting my Instagram so that's pretty manipulative. Twitter is still somehow better, which is saying a lot.",0
I think it would be good,2
Besting app,1
One Of The Best Platform For Text Information posting Batter Then Twitter,2
This app so amazing and have full fill all the requirements,2
This app was advertised as making new friends and being able to interact with new people. But literally it’s just Twitter all the feed is just verified accounts like where is the option to make friends? 😕 Verified accounts don’t interact with normal people let’s be honest. So I don’t understand what this app is for it’s literally just to watch famous people post.,0
Zedge is gay,0
...except you can't see posts made by people you follow. instead you can only see posts made by people you don't care about and don't want to see.,0
Musk ko compitition 👍👍✌️,2
The app not working properly When I open the app its start glitching so I uninstalled this app,0
Aap is so interesting. But it is not good,0
Need option for downloading images. That would be great.,1
Excellent💯,2
There’s no add on for putting your badge back on if you press hide it n profile. Hopefully that gets adjusted to have it in settings.,0
Wonder full app,2

Not an independent social media. All related to Instagram. Even account is created with Instagram details. Can't deactivate account without deactivating Instagram,0
"So far, so good.... Just need to get friends on here.",1
Deletes instagram account also if someone wants yo delete threads account only,0
Good 👍,2
This app is very bad 🥺,0
Only download for zuck bhayya!,1
Copied everything from Twitter 🤢,0
"App seems like it was clearly forced out to capitalize on Twitter controversy, but it has a lot of potential!",1
"This app is the worst version of Twitter, the only thing Lark Lukerberg knows is copy paste from other apps. Twitter is way ahead of this mid app.",0
I like app,2
It's really a nice app and will beat Twitter but the issue I'm facing is profile picture syncing issue,2
Good stuff,2
"Good, but I just wish there was an easier way to access specific folders in your gallery, or post GIFs.",1
Great User experience so far,2

Very bad,0
Copy paste of Twitter,0
Twitter 😭😂,0
"So far so good. Name is a bit confusing with a few other apps but liking the animated logo and familiar feel. It's new so needs some.time to bring features and functionality in (text search for threads a top one for me), but the core product is good.",2
very difficult UI,0
Nice,2
"First here to download, let's do it 🙂",2
Good app take Twitter down,2
"With this new platform, they're taking the concept of storytelling to a whole new level. Will it give Twitter a run for its money?",2
COOL 😎,1
....EXCELLENT! Keep it up! Welcome and Thanks!,2
😘,0
"We all know why this really bad app was made. It censorship is extreme. There’s no freedom of speech in this app. I will not support in any way, shape or form low quality and a copycat.",0
Sucks. Staying with Twitter.,0
Wonder full,2
Without searchable hashtags its really not a viable alternative,0
"Without a proper search function I don't see why this would even claim to contend with Twitter. It took me 10 minutes to lose interest. Might be useful for following friends and idols, but then why another app. Meta has a bunch of them.",0
It is better if the messaging system is enabled in the software.💬,0
"Threads is extremely partisan and one sided. Twitter is light years better and not a branch of the government, don’t waste your time with boring threads.",0
Not so good,0
useless app 😂,0
"Can't even message people on the app, rather twitter",0
This work is done,2
Why if i deleted my threads acc then my ig acc will be deleted too? Thats annoying,0
Wonderful 😊,2
好的。,1
"100% copied, nothing unique",0
Elon and Mark fight gets real now...,1
"Downloaded and linked an account from Instagram and the threads app caused my Instagram app to crash within seconds every time I tried to open the app. Uninstalling the threads app fixed all the Instagram issues I was having. Wild considering it's all one metamess, you'd think it would play together well...",0
"Good so far, but can't see all my followers for some reason.",2
Far better than Twitter 😉,2
"Haa, appku aad buu u fiican yahay. Waayo aragnimadayda abkan waxay noqonee mid cajiib ah. Xaqiiqdii Waan ogahay inay caqabad cusub u tahay Twitter.

I just feel like it's a mixed IG x Twitter,1
I want to delete my account!!,0
"No DM, No search function, No hashtag support, No ability to only see people I follow in my feed and it's just an endless torrent of random verified accounts you've never heard of. This is the brain dead cousin of Twitter; not its replacement. Even with the 600 tweet cap, Twitter has significantly more functionality and purpose.",0
Bakwas,0
Really really like Twitter. This is really a bad copy. Not authentic. Not a new idea. Threads is a model of anti free speech twitter.,0
My experience are so bad and worst experience in this app 🤮🤮🤮😠😠😡😡🤬🤬 this is very bad application please don't install the app,0
"Worst experience 😭😔, i have installed threads just now and its being really like threads 😞, the app has some bugs to be fixed. As i opened the app i the posts weren't clear and were over lapping each other, creating a mess on my screen. It needs to be fixed as early as possible.",0
Terrible experience. Just use mastodon directly.,0
Better than twiiter,2
You need another social media account to use this social media platform. If that's not farming users then idk what is. Using this makes you a 🤡,0
Good,1
"Feed is a bunch of ""threads"" by people that I don't follow, nor interested to follow.",0
Fgc,1
Sooo,2
"I'm unable to post, comment, or like anything. It's been like this since day 2 of the apps launch. Submitted several help requests and nothing came of it. Decided to uninstall today. 👎🏻",0
Nice Good its looking different from other aaps ✌️❤️,2
This is a great start. I’d like a trending section and categories section. But so far so good. Won’t be returning to Twitter.,1
Full of the junk you already don’t want to see promoted on your current insta. Horrible and ugly user interface. Just another want to be Twitter no one asked for.,0
Love it so far,2
Copy insta facebook bur ok,1
I love this app i,2
"Not only is it an incomplete, glitchy app. It broke my Instagram app. After deleting my threads account and uninstalling. My Instagram still has the threads badge on my bio. No matter how many times I press ""remove badge"" to temporarily remove it, the moment I refresh my insta page the badge is back on my bio. Meta is using my bio to advertise this app. I have expressed I hate it by uninstalling it and deleting my account it's disingenuous. Shouldn't my data be deleted? Why is there a badge",0
"Estaria bien que se pudieran poner estados, fijar hilos, que se pudieran hacer llamadas grupales, y una forma de interactuar más con los usuarios",2
Copying Twitter 😱,0
New App. New Vibe 🤝🏾. Well-done @meta 👍🏾,1

I don't see a point of this app,0
Installing time to long,1
Only Instagram user only downloading,2
"It's a great app and it's really easy to navigate but there's still a lot to be done.. Add a Message Button, Add Tags in Search, Add in settings where one can disable or enable Public Replies, that should be private. Thanks",1
"pode melhorar, mas tá muito bom pra uma rede social nova",1

Aman,2
I like threads as compared to Twitter it's more easy n convinent to use.Very user friendly.,2
"So far so good, but i wish it could prioritize the threads of people we follow first, no all i see is threads from people i have no interest in. Please don't ruin it by making just another instagram🙃",1
Mostly viral app,1

Wow! I can't believe. This is really a fantastic and user-friendly application from Meta. Perfect application for Instagram users. Meta really satisfied us with this gorgeous application. Just gorgeous! Highly recommend it.,2
"When scrolling, the images and texts get confused",1
I do think twitter is better than this,1
🤢🤮🤮,0
"Easy sign up, easy invite to friends!",2
Tried for a bit and it feels like a less than half-cooked Twitter without any valuable conversations.,0

App crashing while trying to upload pictures,1
Really good aap I just want a aap which can replace Twitter and look here it is,2
"Every time I try to post a new Thread post with a new pic, I get kicked out. EVERY TIME. It's BS.",0
"This is a great twitter-style app. Nice, simple flow. However, it’s missing a couple features that would enhance the experience.

1. Direct messaging - being able to share threads directly to someone’s inbox and chat back and forth. We all love getting those relatable reels from our friends every day, so why not do the same with threads?

2. Multiple accounts - to truly unify this as a Meta app, being able to log into multiple accounts and switch between them easily is a huge help for independent creators/business owners that need to share content between several different accounts.

If these features are added, consider me a definite user!",1
No way to sign up from the app. You need an existing Instagram account which I don't have and don't want to install just so I can create an account to try threads.,0

"I still don’t want to see content from people that I don’t specifically follow unless I explicitly search for it. And when I do search, I want to see an option for complete searches and not just user searches. This is a bare-bones poor clone of Twitter that seemingly is just getting some initial traction due to political bias. No thanks - fix it. Also, if you don’t provide a web desktop option to use the service, it’s a double whammy.",0

"Update: Threads cannot handle dark mode, and it is automatic. so after 9 p.m. it is impossible to use, at least on Android 9 ------- more than half the time, threads shows a garbled mess of letters on an Android phone. also, threads has no means to report this it sure would be nice if they had some sort of feature to send a picture and show them what it looks like, or simply have a way to message or report an app issue",0

"i think its an great app but lot of room for improvement. I hope you guys will add amazing futures in it like dm, hastags more and more feep up the good work.",2
"The app is good, but the app is unnecessary. With a/an Facebook/Instagram/Twitter previously in use, I find minimal usage for a [new] version of the same apps. Also... you will delete your personal IG account when you delete Threads, which is not only redundant, but a directly violation of my intellectual rights, and there is no NDA, MOU/MOA, or any other contractual agreements within the terms and agreements, prior to you logging in, and/or your account being pre-setup by the [app], itself.",1

"Objectively better than the alternatives. It's really that simple. Mastodon was ok but everyone left. Twitter was great before it turned into a barely functional sewer fire. Can't tell you about Bluesky because it's been in closed beta since the beginning of time itself. By default, Threads is pretty good. I'd give it 5 stars if it had trending topics/tags and a desktop web app.",1

This app is really great. I seen it on the news and I thought I should try it it’s way better than Twitter. If I were you I would get this to there’s a bunch of interesting creators on there and it’s just really great that’s for my age now thank you threads.,2
Why am I unable to post videos on my thread ?? It’s frustrating,0
Plus it censors a bunch.,0
They should not have linked threads to instagram. Followers on threads is synced through instagram by default and if you remove people on threads they get removed on instagram also. There is nothing extra this app provides apart from instagram and twitter. Seriously don't think there was an actual need for this app.,0
"Amazing replacement for twitter! Grows like crazy, too!",2
Good app,2
Excellent.,2

More fimilier than Twitter,2
Greetings and blessings to the developer team the app is really good and the ideology is great some people might not love it but it's good. But ... I'm repeatedly facing an issue of not being able to login on insta and threads at the same time so i cannot repost my threads post on insta. This may be a bug but it's a big one and pretty much capable of irritating the user. I'd love if you fixed it.,0
Nice app,1
Good so far. Still early days of course.,1
Nice UI,2
Verify me 😂😂,2
I liked it compared to Twitter..i got 2 followers in just a minute..but Twitter gives me almost 8 years straight to have 8 followers 🤔,2

"I managed to make a few posts, comments, and shares before it started to crash. I can view feeds and profiles and I can like posts but when I go to comment or create a post it crashes- app closes out. I have logged out and logged back in ( which worked once) and I have deleted and reinstalled the app several times. There isn't anything wrong with my internet connection, I have plenty of space, no additional apps running in the background and both my iPhone and the app itself are at their current updated version. I have tagged them in issues on Instagram stories, I have messaged directly and then managed to send a ticket through the app all with no response. I understand if this was a user-wide issue due to the app being new but it is not. I would have better to say because I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the beginning but can no longer enjoy because I can no longer engage. A fix is needed.",0
A new social media app yet you can't even do a hashtag? A one simple thing that all of socmed has even Facebook and Instagram yet there's none in Threads. Like what?,0
Very nice appp,2

As well as this, the lack of tags seems to be a problem if it's not added soon. Other then that, a very good start and already better then Twitter.",1

"1.	Adjustable Text Size: Provide users with the option to modify the size of the text within the application’s interface, allowing for customization based on individual preferences.

2.	Profile Photo Zoom: Implement functionality that enables users to click on a profile photo, triggering a larger view of the image for better visibility and detail.

3.	Dim Mode: Introduce a dark blue-themed dim mode within the application, offering an alternative visual style that is less intense than the typical night black mode.

4.	Hashtags: Incorporate support for hashtags, enabling users to add and search for specific topics or themes by utilizing relevant hashtags within the application.

5.	Following-Only Feed: Create a separate feed within the application that exclusively displays content from users that the current user follows, providing a personalized and tailored experience.

6.	Trending Page: Implement a dedicated page that showcases trending topics, hashtags, or popular content within the application, allowing users to stay informed about popular discussions and current trends.",1

An obvious cash grab by Zuckerberg to mimic twitter. Only gripe is the inability to delete your threads account once you create it. You have to delete your entire instagram account once you create it if you wanna get rid of it. New users beware,1

"I like the threads app for meta, but I am concerned it could share the wrong data. Is there a way to make sure it doesn't leak any secure data, gps info, or location to that closed social media site, Mastodon.

Wonderful,2
"Pros:
1. Easy to follow the community you’ve already built on Instagram

2. Posting is pretty straightforward 

Cons:
1. No functioning hashtags so hard to find community if you’re not already on Instagram 

2. No way to see the posts of people you’re actually following in your feed so it’s a bunch of noise from accounts you probably don’t care about 

3. No trending topics

4. No way to post from the web that’s not through the app

This needs a lot of work to truly replace Twitter but the built in community aspect makes it an easy sell. I’m not sure I’ll use it beyond sign up if the cons aren’t fixed soon, though.",0

ANOTHER GARBAGE FROM META - A copycat app which is launched to compete with Tweeter but it pales in comparison to this app & moreover it is confusing wether it is a stand-alone app or part of Instagram because while logging you have to go through the hassle of logging through this app,0

Pretty good so far. Even though if I want to delete my account I have to delete my Instagram as well. Still better than Twitter under Twitters current circumstances.,2
"Nothing new, same old boring",0
Need a draft for threads and sometimes it doesn't allow me to upload higher quality or size images and videos and even when that is the case it should mention the reason why the post was not uploaded rather than 'Unable to post' . Otherwise all good.,1

"Love it. It's going to take time to get all of our friends from the app that shall not be named over to Threads, so be patient with the content. Much like Instagram, it's going to show you celebrity content first. Just mute those accounts and seek out the content you want. Politics? Start with news orgs, then move to journalists. By 48-72 hours it'll start shaping up to what you had on the app that shall not be named pre hostile takeover by ""him.""",2
"Why anyone would give this more than one star given how bad it is? And I don't care if it's just ""starting out."" They had a chance to make this good at launch, KNOWING their competition at twitter, take the good parts from twitter and IMPROVE on it. But they didn't. Also considering this is owned by FB/Instagram, I'm not expecting this to get any better. Already bad enough I see posts from people THAT I DON'T FOLLOW, instead of the people I DO follow. So much for a ""twitter killer.""",0
"Needw a lot of work..the whole feed being taken up by people you've no interest in, or follow ia stupid. That's just the ""for you"" page like Twitter, which we all hate. And don't want.",0
"We have to keep in mind that its the initial stage of the app ,there will be bugs glitches ,and crashes. But one thing we can't deny man this blew up ,like people rushed to threads like ,fathers rush away to get milk (kidding) but the best thing about this app is no cheap theatrics like you can basically buy blue ticks (for a monthly subscription) [musk-the-mugger].

This app is literally a copy cat of Twitter. Nothing about it is original. I’m suprised Twitter can’t sue for how similar the app is layed out. My threads account is connected to my Instagram and in order to delete my account on threads I would have to do so to my Instagram. Are you serious…. I regret being curious and downloading it. The badge won’t leave my Instagram bio. I hate it.,0

Definitely needs some work to be done on it (lacking a messaging feature and switching accounts takes longer than it should) but a really solid social media platform.,1
"For the devs, here are pointers on how you can improve the app: 1. Allow users to save pictures. 2. Only censor porn on profiles below 18. 3. Have a translation feature. 4. Do not repeat the same mistake as Twitter where accounts that the users aren't following are appearing on their feed. If y'all just wanna make a Twitter ripoff, at least make it a better version from the very start.",1

"App looks good but it's unfinished.I can't download pics no # . Like button should be on right or at least can change left or right . Meta just rush it out cuz they wanna be the first to rival with Twitter.Still need a lot to do and I don't think this will beat Twitter cuz main reason people use Twitter is because nsfw content.Thread should at least allow nsfw content and give user whether they wanna hide it or not.Its not that difficult,other social media app have it.",0

"I’m really trying to like this app. I want more positive social media and I think Threads can deliver. However, the feed is absolutely terrible. Despite following accounts I am interested in and liking content I may enjoy, the apps feed is utterly rubbish. Too many corporate accounts, celebrities, and influencers. If that’s your thing, this app is for you. I will be spending time on other apps until this is fixed.",0
So far so good. Leta see!,2

Really?! I don’t need to see what random people are doing/saying. A couple of friends and I downloaded the app expecting to see each other and anyone else we are ‘friends’ with show up in our account. Instead we got a plethora of strangers and celebrities that we ended up blocking or hiding. Please let us pick who we want to see on our thread. We might not be keeping the app. In a word….disappointed.,0

HORRIBLE buggy bad wannabe twitter. Drains battery bug. Heats up all devices. Interferes with wifi and mobile network settings. Ignores permission denials. Breaks privacy apps settings. This should be banned and illegal. Horrible. Google play should be ashamed.,0

Feels like browsing Twitter if I had Alzheimer's. No tags so you're shouting into a void. Can't find fanart easily. Feed littered with posts from people I have no clue who they are and I have nothing in common with.,0

"It’s a good rival to Twitter. Twitter has been on a downwards trend for a little while now and I’m glad to see competition emerge. It was definitely rushed out to capitalize on Twitters Rate Limit issues, but I genuinely believe Threads can be the next big Twitter replacement, but it needs a little time. I’ll be rooting for it from the sidelines.",2

This app is pretty trash and doesn’t have a future.",0

Can't sign up without an Instagram account. Not signing up to that rubbish app again. Will stay with the real Twitter quite happily.,0
"Add thread *pinned 📌* feature , That would be very cool",1
App is overall good but you have to click everytime on 🔇 to get the video sound. This is too much irritating. I want sound version like insta. There we didn't need everytime click on sound to play sound. Everything is good 👍 Solve my problem & I'll change my review to 5⭐. Thank You!,1

Very poor app quality,0
This app is good. But Twitter is best.,2
"It's decent thus far, it definitely needs a translate thread feature, you can't search keywords and there's no tags to find specific things, so there's no real way to 'grow' except for finding your friends on the app. You can post pictures and videos, quote threads and repost threads. There's no DM system, which is fair enough. I do expect the app to get better in coming updates, but for now it's kind of lacking.",1

Waste of time and data,0
Cheap copy of Twitter and insecure it's take your data and use for different activities don't download this app,0
Lets start,0
"I downloaded it and didn't like it because of it is a replica of Twitter and offers nothing different and innovative. It is heavily biased too and you can get censored for sharing funny Zuck memes. Anyways, I then deleted the account and lost my Instagram of 7 years in the process because I didn't read the fine print. I don't recommend this. Stick to IG or Twitter.",0
This app needs a chat system,0
Useless app Useless platform,0
"I would really like it more if I could curate my feed. Facebook, insta, tumblr, reddit, are all positive experiences because I am able to customize my feed experience to my interests. I don't necessarily mind seeing things I didn't intentionally follow, but it should allow me to choose. I'm also really not interested in the inanity of those with massive followings. I much prefer actual conversations with people who aren't here To Produce Content.",0
Requires instagram so no thanks. Why the hatred for Facebook?,0
"This app is so disgusting because there are no girls in this app, it's full of white skinned bulls and I follow 2000 people but no one follow me..very unsatisfied mark.",0
Screen error while opening it can't operate,0
"I really didn't like the app, first of all it's not working. Lots of glitches are there..not be able to post or see any post.....and i really want to delete it without deleting my Instagram account 😭...both accounts are linked",0
"Not good at all, doesn't provides uh a dekstop or web version, crashes alot and made it so annoying that if uh join this then it's compulsory to have ur account activated otherwise if uh r gonna deactivate it, uh will end up loosing ur ig account too,as both of them would be deleted simultaneously. You'll end up regretting ur decision to create an account on this.",0
The best app that is worth to be rated 5 stars,2
It's a bad app everything is stuck,0

I just like it❤️,2

So far so good. No bugs and feels better than Twitter and only time will tell how good the recommendations are as it learns. Maybe integrate the dm feature from Instagram. Also can we have a single integrated meta login?,2
"Really cool app, free to use unlike twitter",2
"I love the features, it's a 10/10 for me",2
Interesting but simler to the Twitter,0
"I'm liking the concept! There is room for improvement though. Everytime I try to attach a photo to a thread, the app crashes. I haven't been able to add a photo at all. I also can't seem to find a way to view a list of only the people I follow. There's always other folks mixed in the list. Finally, I can't seem to edit my posts. I make a lot of typos! I can edit my posts on Facebook and Insta but not here? Weird.",1
Don't have an Instagram account and was no prompt to just make an account for this app. Maybe they'll figure it out later but currently useless app for me,0
Future app.,2
This the best app right now and Elon mad 🤣🤣,2
This app nice and The best whit twitter,2
Nice,2
"This is app is nice but pretty simple. I would like the use of hashtags, I would like to be able to post polls and ask questions, and I don’t like the long number on my Instagram profile. I like the idea of there being a link to our threads account, but the number is ugly and I don’t like it. Otherwise, I think I’m into it.",1

What i was expecting? It give bluecheck to those who has real names having nic id. It should be separate from Instagram It should not collect people's data It should have unique timeline (like Twitter).

"Good, but where are de DMs?",2
"Quite simply it keeps all your OG apps together in a sense: Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and now Threads (Twitter ran by an actual social media mogul) in Meta. If you want a smooth transition from Instagram to another way of expressing yourself via Threads, this is the app for you. Instagram links to Threads via your profile and vice versa making them simple extensions of each-other rather than being completely indifferent apps. Good Job so far 👌🏾",2

"The app works great and looks good.

However,

I like to group accounts I follow so I can see only a few of them at a time.

For example:  if I was following a slew of newspapers and other media, I might have a group called “media.”  If I wanted to check up in what was happening in science lately, I would have a list named “science” which contained the accounts which posted mostly scientific discoveries and research.

I cannot stress how useful this grouping, filing or classification tool would be.  Without it, the information I receive is just jumbled and without order. 

To be truly useful, information received must be ordered and stored and if Threads strives for true utility the ability to function as an encyclopedia is truly necessary.",1

It's a new trending app ..it's good but I think that there is something you should fix it... like there is no conversation feature... sometimes it's lack when you scrolling ...in settings there should be set dark theme...if you have android version 10 or you have iOS 14 latest version then you can enable dark theme if you don't have you can't....but it is not so bad not so good...😃,1

Once this is addressed, I think I'd be inclined to spend more time using this app but for now it's kind of tedious and boring",0

It sucks,0
Amazing trends an instagram on my viral video,2
nice,2
I am having problems with this app when I start the app it crashee in all around,0
First comment/review!,2
Look very similar to Twitter... But quite interesting one of the best feature is it is connected to Instagram.. so we cane follow the same people's..... Definitely it can beat the Twitter,1
"Clean view, wish you could only see people you follow in chronological order.",1
Just add feature to download images & turn night mode on/off in the app itself.,1
Beautiful,2
"It seems like this app is read-only since every time I tap the ""write post"" button, it crashes. 

Also, the timeline shows posts from accounts I'm not following, so I have to mute pretty much every single one of them (only ~5% of posts are from people I follow)",0
Mark Zuckerberg Vs Elon Musk,2
Amazing Initiative by Instagram Love This,2
Nice app 👍,1
Follow me on singhsurya8477 on threads this is a very good platform to like Twitter.,2
Looks like cheap copy of instagram.... Not even bit closer to Twitter. Its so cheap my words cant explain it. I was excited for it but it ruined everything. Tooo cheap quality.,0
Bakwas app,2
"CONS: 1. I cannot download videos in this app. 2. Always show me someone who I don’t follow, I don’t know who they are, same issue like instagram. 3. I really wanna see some real trending news or search some news I interested. 4. I can not copy any words or sentences in this app .
PROS: UI is better looking than Twitter, beat Elon Musk and twitter.",1
Ina Da Magana!,2
Great app almost similar to twitter. Lol i love the vibe with the app but why does it scramble when you try scrolling through posts?,1
I've just opened it and it doesn't work it gaves me like Screen tearing and I can't use it please fix it,0
Homepage of the application is not loading on my phone.,1
🇮🇳🚩Jai shree Ram 🚩🇮🇳 Dosto,2
Sigh... it's boring but it will eventually get better in the future.,1
😇,2
Intial release is fine. It's has to improve in editing option to everyone like an insta post.,1
The worst app by meta. It behaves like a bug and the pages are overlapping each other. No matter what I try it's the same... Hate it,0
you should be able to share someones insta acct from the instagram app to threads. just a suggestion,1
Ok,1
It's great 😊,2
"Version 1 is ok Bug I've noticed is when I click notifications where multiple people liked one of my posts, the app crashes (Android)",1
Very slow when browsing,0
Second day with app and there's a bug. The app won't open and says I've changed the password. I have not. Disappointed.,0
Boring.,0
Better than twitter,2
This app is very nice bhai 😎😎 Apna Chhota Bheem Singh and comments karo,2

I think some of yall just need a new phone ☠️,2
Wow,2
"This app puts google to shame for what it collects on you. No app is worth this amount of access.. Several million have already made the mistake of putting their real info into this, don’t be one of them. Wasn’t this supposed to be “safe” you are handing them ALL info on your device, no literally, all of it.",0
"Great app though,but i will try to keep inspecting",2

"can't create new account, can only use instagram account",0
INSTAGRAM,2
Please bring the sound in videos which I have uploaded in this app. Voice is not working. please like and follow me. Increase my followers and make my all videos viral,2
"A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws into it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.",1
So good so far,1
What a great app threads.....!!! Let's join!!!,2
"Thread is best experience for our brand and small business to spread the content, sales and growth the businesses 👍🏻",2

I don't have any issues whatsoever with threads😍 this is even better than twitter,2
Better Than Twitter,2
"edit after a few days: Ok the randomness was fun for a bit, but its continued usability for me hinges completely on search. Search is still the biggest advantage of Twitter and the reason many are still unwilling to move. If they screw up search I am dropping this app like a hot potato. 

I'm loving Threads so far! 🌈🌟 but it can't replace Twitter for me until it has >>> FULL-TEXT SEARCH WITH FILTERS <<< We need a way to find stuff without waiting for the algorithm to drip-feed us.",1
Innovative application,2
Love it 😍,2
it was hard to login couldn't use it,0
Who’s idea was it to release a new app without any way to create a new account for it? Am I expected to download Instagram so that I can sign up there? Absolutely ridiculous for a new platform trying to establish itself.,0
I hate Twitter since musk took over..bye musk,2
"4stars because I can't save images. Otherwise, great app",1
The app's color layout is looking like a broken glitchy computer monitor... What's going on? 😣,0
Good app. But I would be more happy if this doesn't link with Instagram. Make this separate . 🎉,2
"I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta 👍🏻",1
Nice app thank you Instagram,2
Useful app,2
Copy cat of twitter 😂🤣🤣,1
Good,2
It should be having a personal messaging feature also.. I totally loved this app and it's just fab 😍 Just the above mentioned update can make it perfect 😃,1
"It suddenly closes. I thought I just accidentally hit my home button but no. I was typing but overtime, it suddenly closes. There was even no draft of the text I was composing. Happened multiple times. I just updated this app and thought that it would fix the issue, but no. This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.",0
A Liberal sh*thole. Not worth trying it. You'll be censored.,0
التطبيق لا يعم بشكل مستقر عند تشغيله وفيه لاج كثير. The application does not work stably,0
Good than others,2
"Not Twitter or Tiktok = banging app, plus I like how it's similar to Mastodon",2
"It has been 4 days I cannot post anymore. It says “post failed to upload”. I restarted the app, cleaned the cache , did it all, but nothing is working. I like the app but we use our social media for business and this is becoming a bit annoying. 
Can you help?",0
Well I kinda like this new app,1
"Just downloaded the app (brand new) and I already like it, tbf I think it's better than Twitter but that's my opinion. I can't wait for the future work that will be put into this (future updates). *Definitely recommended!*",2
This app makes Facebook look like it respects your privacy. Read the fine print.,0
Even icon.🤣 3 minutes to make it. Surely Elon ll win in the box match. Theads is better then Twitter.,2

Acha copy,2
I love the idea of threads and I would prefer it over twitter but I hate the fact that I do NOT see any posts from the ones I follow. I DONT care about the #foryou. I want to support my friends….,0
"You are just signing IN to an Instagram account. You cannot sign UP for a NEW Thread account, so all they are doing is transfering Instagram members into Thread members. Seems like a good way to limit conversations to only those they already know. Sort of like the Democrats calling themselves something else to register more votes. Sneaky ploy.",0

It's hard to download,0
"Overall a good experience so far, however could be improved. I have only used it for a day but inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts which are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to. It would be helpful to have hashtags available but I understand that at the moment, the app is a new launch and still has a lot of development to go through. Hopefully will be able to give five stars in the future.",1

I am not for sure if it’s buggy, but I had a notification that I on the icon that would not go away, even uninstalling and reinstalling it.

All the privacy stuff is concerning.  Also user should be able to delete it without having to delete your Instagram account.",0

"I was sent a ""Your account has been suspended."" message from instagram a day after using this app (without any posts to Threads *or* Instragram, note.)

"Twitter already exists. This a worse-made clone. Different platforms are supposed to be different. It is more wonky than Twitter and has a worse user interface. There is no option to just see the threads of people you follow, leading the page to be filled with recommendations that are not interesting.

It wants to be Twitter but comes off as an underdeveloped cheap knockoff.",0

Very well designed app,2
I'm one that I didn't hate or love Twitter. But I thought I would try this out like the other social apps recently. And Threads has it right it's easy to use and I like that you can just use all of you just snyc all of your IG followers. They have that info anyway. The only thing is there's not very much socializing Yet.,2

"When I open “the bird app” it loads upwards, it holds my place in my feed so I can start where I left off.

"I like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads. I like the panorama photo presentation, too, it's slick.

"This app is really a nice fresh start! I just want it to have some better function and ofc I know that it has just started so it is still in initial phase. FIRST, I want the post button on top not down since we have to close the keyboard to post. Scrolling also lags a little. Moreover hashtags??? We need hashtags to reach some kind of audience and I want to have a feature to search for threads.",0
Wanted to use for my photography bussiness can't post any photos. Fails everytime,0
Best app,1
Let's see.. Very good,2
haven’t seen any bug untill now but the scrolling animation is too much laggy and it feels too much annoying. this should be 120fps like meta's other app.,0

When i scroll the app glitches and one post will be all over the place,0
Bug problem,0
the apps was fine but the problem is that i can't delete my thread's account and i can't hide the badge. i installed it by accident before i know that i can't delete the threads acc so please make a way for those that doesn't want to have the threads account to delete their account.,0
App is so good But want to add the unhide threads id option,1
Twitter has been gone!!,2

My favourite “Threads” tip so far: Easily reshare any message to your IG story by tapping the paper airplane (share) icon and then selecting “Add to Story”,1
Nice working app like Twitter .. 👍,1
Not Working!!,0
Yh! The app is cool. It's more than Twitter. I even prefer it more than Twitter.,2
Bad,0
Fantastic app,2
Very nice app 💯💯,2
The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do. One thing that I would love to see on the app is that you can upload videos on Threads and the other thing is that you can delete your profile and data because I have read that the only way to delete the data is to delete your Instagram account which I don't like because it's going to upset people when they want to delete their threads data.,1
Na inum yathala yathitu soldren daw,2
Literally a copy,0
Poor swipe at Meta stealing Twitter and your data. Look at how Meta apps track you,0
mudah mudahan better than twitter,2
Whenever I open this app it's glitches I can't able use this app,0
I love this app!,2
Don't install this app,0
"Came over from Twitter, where I primarily used my account for semi-professional networking.

The pros:
• quite a bit of my network has followed because Threads is well put together
• making account was easy, albeit required I make a new instagram account
• more or less functions how everyone would expect

The one giant con is that there’s no following page. I’m a young person who follows (and enjoys) some of the pop culture pages on my personal account, where I follow them. I don’t want to see them on my professional account, where I’m scrolling to see what’s new in my field. Although less of an issue, the vice versa is also true. 

This feels like an easy fix that should be top of the list - give me the option to just look at the interactions of who I signed up to follow!",1

It is actually not good to me I am not sure if it is because of my phone but it acts weard when I scroll 📜 down 👇 🚮,0
Immediately got blasted with all things political (so many posts from AOC and others). Content didn’t seem appealing and all this stuff can be found on Instagram.,0
"Liking this app so far, many aspects of it’s current state of simplicity is enjoyable compared to many of these bloated apps today- not sure if there’s intention to keep it this way. 

One thing I don’t like so much is the feed right now. I know I don’t follow many people and they aren’t posting, but there are a lot of posts I don’t want to see, a majority of them. Maybe an interest flow or something could get this right. Not sure. But currently I don’t want to see a majority of the threads on my feed",1
"App is generic, took a long time to install. Requires Instagram, nothing but Instagram without pictures. Don't waste your time, just another app.",0

This is the best yet ♥️♥️ we love meta😂,2

i love the app so far it looks amazing. it’s just pretty annoying that i keep getting logged out. also wish it had the switch account option like instagram so that i wouldn’t have to keep logging out to go on another account. i know it’s a brand new app so i will be looking forward to the updates.,1
I'm under the water🙂,1
Threads is my home. I can’t imagine my life without Threads. Please never remove it from the App Store.,2

"I got regretted when I created an account at this trash app. Also it stopped working just because I'm in the country that the app is not available. I used VPN to access and after 2-3 days, the posts stopped showing and says ""something went wrong, try again"" and I can't post as well, and even If I want to deactivate my account it says ""failed to deactivate"". What's wrong with this trashy app. There is Twitter and is enough, there is no need for creating a clone trash with same idea as Twitter.",0
What’s the point of this app? It’s EXACTLY another Twitter imitation app marketed by Meta’s paid celebrities and “news” outlets.,0
Awesome app I use this app and injoy this.,2

Come to find out from a friend in IT that it collects A LOT of info about you and you CANNOT delete it without deleting your Instagram too. You can deactivate, but not delete, there’s no walking it back unless you delete Instagram too. honestly I’m so appalled by this I probably will delete Instagram, although that’s not without some sadness as that’s a platform I do like.",0

The app is great and I like I can connect to my favourite celebrity's. However since I downloading and installing threads my instagram has been hack into 4 times which I had to reset my password.

"Well designed, easy to use, but it's refusal to allow any content that could be labeled ""nsfw"" makes it an easy pass as a true Twitter alternative. Political or personal opinions aside, without some sort of option to allow content in that category, it will continue to needlessly kneecap it's self. No normal person is going to use both apps, and way more then are willing to openly say it will continue using Twitter for this reason alone.",0

"I definitely think this app is a good idea but it’s missing a few key features that still make Twitter better such as having a following tab so I can just see threads from the people I follow, a notifications tab so I can see the threads that I turned notifications on for without having to search for them after I open the app, if those two things were implemented this app could be better than Twitter",1

Not bad... Take love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🖤💓,2
great app,2
I give 5 star but the developer should make something important which is the ability to download image videos etc,2
there are a lot of bugs on this app. when i tried to scroll down the text getting blurry and unreadable.,0
Nice,2
Want to see what its all about but app keeps force closing when I'm typing something for some reason?!,0
This app is tha very middile class app.,1
Amazing you can connect you Instagram acc to threads which is nice.5* rating.....,2
Where are the notifications? The app doesn't have ability to notify you when an account publishes a new thread. Pretty good and fun app otherwise,1
"Is it a better alternative to Twitter? I think so thus far, though it’s missing some folks I really liked following on the other app. But what’s getting me is this: this first version is glitchy. It just randomly started closing the window whenever I try to reply to people or write a new “thread”. Cool idea, good initiative, but needs work.",1
Congratulations 🤗🌹,2
Terrible App ... crashing every 3 minutes,0
All in one 🔥🔥📈,2
The best better than twitter.,2

"Honestly the cross platform features with Instagram and Facebook make this app better than Twitter, I can find all my friends and family and I’ll be quite frank:

This app is the next Facebook, it combines Instagram and Facebook into one application.

So far not bad .. we wait to see what they will add to it,2
Just,2
"Looks cool, but it needs a lot of features.",1
Good,2
It's a great application,2
"Publicity highly misleading. Should be a stand-alone app but instead it's only available tied to your Instagram account. If it WERE stand-alone, I would most probably use it - the world needs an alternative to Twitter... AND to Instagram (even though they're both Meta). Uninstalled.",0
Because it's not made by Elon musk,2
Oorah,2
"No organization. I cant find the accounts i follow. You know what this app reminds me of.....oh yea, TWITTER!! You are not ready. Pull the plug and go back to the drawing board.",0

Bad aap 😡😡😡😡,0
Nice app over all,2
"Right now, it's a void. Very little of what you actually want to see shows up, and the rest is noise from bigger accounts (verified army) and ads. We'll see what it becomes eventually (your following does creep through every now and then, but not nearly enough). I do think the UI is clean though.",0
Let's see where Threads will lead us to... Just like Twitter. I'm loving this already....,1
Not working properly,0
It good,2
"My feed is filled with verified users I don’t even follow, and you can only search for accounts in the explore section, no topics or hashtags.

Also my Activity section is stuck on loading and won’t show any notifications even if they appear on my lockscreen. Please fix this.",0

"The app is lagging too much i can't even see my profile,go to the settings or see followers and anything. Maybe it's because the app is still new but i hope this problem will be solved soon",0

Worst app ever seen,0
i think THIS i's better for Twitter every body yous it this amazing apps,2
I am so excited as using the new app,2
Let it be just for sharing what’s on our minds. Keep instagram for photos. Don’t let what so called influencers ruin the app for their ego boost likes and comments,1
UI looks clean but Please provide save picture or video option. Also Home feed looks odd. It should show the posts from who we follow or show related to who we follow or based on our location,1
All is well,2
Amazing,2
"The whole app becomes distorted as soon as i touch the screen after opening it. can not scroll, click anything let alone use the app.",0

Best aap tq so much all them,2
"If you decide to delete your account with this app, you can’t! You must also delete your instagram account! This app is a trap and will not let you out. There’s also been some immediate concerns with data sharing and selling users info for profit. And that’s aside from this app already being worse than Twitter ever was, concerning censorship, lies, and approved racism. Stay away, unless you like being censored and having your information stolen.",0
okay this is soooooo lekker new trend wow I'm excited,1
💜💜,2
loveit,2
Very nice 👍,2
it some eadar,2
More anxiety to watch this app,1
Worst . Twitter is Best .,0
Pretty cool concept. The app is slow and doesn’t offer as many features as Barkle and Twitter. Everyone on the app either is verified or doesn’t exist,0
"The app is glitchy. The interface is shaking. Can't read what's on the screen. It's a bug, needs to fix it.",0
Just alright...needs much improvement...I'm seeing alotta thread accts showing up on my feed that I don't follow...seems like the random accts show up when an acct I am following responds to their post or vice versa...would like that to change...might delete since this is a nuisance..,0
Cant able to install why its nt working,0
Reminds me of Facebook. Timeline of random stuff that you don’t subscribe to. It’s whatever Zuck wants you to see and not see.,0
They won't let you delete your account. The only way to do that is to delete your Instagram account.,0

"No web version and we must have Instagram in order to use it that is BS and the functionality wise very basic version of Twitter.. At least try to accommodate some of the great feature of Twitter,and call it Beta version to stop getting bombarded with the negative reviews. Good luck,Zuke.",0

Try to improve so as it may totally work like twitter,2

"Eh is missing some things, but the bots in this app is too much.",0

Great app by Instagram loving it 😀,2
this app is great! 5 stars from a person who personally does not rate apps nor likes insta as much as i did years ago. however threads feels like Twitter from like 2014 and 15 before it went wild. it's a nice feeling and i recommend downloading it for a nostalgia feel haha.,2
Worse app,0
it's Very Good App like Instagram make early account to take your Name,2
"1-we need a trending list for every region, just like Twitter. So that people can know what's going around the world. 2-when posting pics or videos, it doesn't give us the option to choose from different folders like Twitter does. 3-when typing a long reply, the view doesn't automatically adjust to show what we're typing. Instead, we have to scroll up to see the rest of what we're typing.",1

I restarted my phone, deleted the app to see if the problem will get fixed but no. I tried other suggestions as well. I have the latest version",0

Just like Twitter! What was needed to make it like Twitter? & it has the biggest problem that is if we wanna delete threads also we have to delete our Instagram account. What is it?Whenever I want to click on it & start to scroll it starts to show me its glitching.I don't know why it's going on my app. I think some users are facing this same problem. Please fix it urgently. Also after hiding badge we need a option to reset it again on our profile. Please create this feature,0

"Threads suns smoothly, is simple, and really easy to use. Best of all, it’s not bogged down with bad algorithms that bury the content I want under ads and promoted content! Let’s hope meta keeps it that way. 

So far this has been, for me, more enjoyable to use than instagram. I’ve never used twitter so I can’t say, but there’s gotta be a reason I’ve never bothered. 

Please don’t mess this up, Mark, don’t ruin this for us. Keep it pure. Keep it for the people, not the investors. Let the other ad-laden social media apps carry this one financially. We desperately need a USEFUL social media app, and this has the potential to do it!",2

"I made a parody account on Thread and within a couple hours it was suspended even though it clearly (in bio and user name) was not the person it was parody of.  Their “appeals” process only allowed for me to confirm a password and phone number. You cannot actually appeal, or fix whatever they determined was a violation in the first place. One I submitted my “appeal” (only phone number and password) within seconds they somehow were able to determine the ban was worthy of being permanent. Another gem of an app from the Zuckerberg farm. Further they’ll appeal all your accounts associated w your phone number (across meta/Facebook, Instagram, etc too) even if those did not violate any rules. Do not trust them with your data and use at your own risk!",0

Just being in the anticipation zone for now. It's a new app. Can't say much but hope for a great service. I would love it to not be a copycat to Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg should think out of the box and bring in more features to make it number 1 go to app. Hello Thereaders. Let's have fun.,1

Also, if you don’t provide a web desktop option to use the service, it’s a double whammy.",0

"Everything you do on Thread gets transferred over to all your IG accounts. I was unfollowing people on my threads that I don’t want to follow (I hit follow all when I signed up), and got blocked for 7 days on all my IG accounts. I don’t think Threads should be directly connected to all your IG accounts, meaning the activity you do shouldn’t influence getting blocked, especially for 7 days!!",0
Why Threads doesn't allow us to sign up using our email address or phone number? We don't want to use Instagram account to log in. Hope to add this feature in the future. Thanks,2

Doesn't work as a stand alone platform. Wasn't interested in getting Instagram but to use this you must have an Instagram account and then if you don't like it you can't delete it without deleting your Instagram account too. No thanks.,0

I’m excited for this app but the MAJORITY of my feed is people I don’t follow and brands! Please stop. I don’t want those on my home page. I’m happy to check recommended content on an explore page but what’s the point of choosing who to follow if the app is going to decide what I’m going to see for me??,0
It keeps on closing whenever I post a photo. 😥,0
something new ig..,2
I was super excited but you can't sign up for a new account you must use an Instagram account. It claims you only need an email but once you are done creating your account it immediately requires a phone number or it just freezes.,0
Its incredible,2
Really nice,2
It is So much better then Twitter,2
Could be banned just for nothing.. nooo will stay on twitter,0
Dear Team. Not sure am I the only one. But in my app there are too many glitches. I use Android. I hope you can fix it soon. Thanks 👍,1
nic,1
Facebook is better than this. No one can beat Facebook.,0
😊😊,2
loven it!,2
Showstopper that you can not limit your feed to only those you follow forcing you to wade through all sorts of garbage. Back to the Tw original for now . Can't believe they launched without this,0
Really such a great app.. Now it's not been a lack of Twitter.. this thread have have all the opportunities that other app can't have.. Great app and Good job Zuckerberg for developing such kind of app😍,2
"Ever since I downloaded this app, my main Instagram account that is linked to Threads doesn't want to work.",0
Time taken to reach 1 million users: Netflix - 3.5 years Twitter - 2 years Facebook - 10 months Spotify - 5 months Instagram - 2.5 months ChatGPT - 5 days Threads - 7 hours,2
Great experience so far,2
Nice app,2
Good app . However on thing we request is to have the translation there. Not all of us read a particular language . If have I will change mine to at least a four star for now,0
"absolutely love using threads. It has made connecting with friends and family so much easier and more convenient. The user interface is intuitive,I highly recommend it!",2

"There is no going back! To delete your account, the only way you can do it is to delete your Instagram account! Take a look at all the data they collect that is connected to you - including your health information and sensitive data, your location, and purchase history!",0
"Can’t remove badge from my instagram page, even though it says you can’t add it back one you remove it and it keeps showing up",0
Amazing,2
"It's a good app but you need to make it independent not to link it up with instagram when signing in, and we need a lite version this is too heavy to some android phones",1
Worst app,0
Can't log in unless I already have an IG account? No option to create a basic IG account upon install? I'm out. Zuck sells all your data. He went to congress about it. He got caught. Not a fan of Musk but this should be a stand alone app. No need for IG. Btw..you can't delete Threads without deleting your IG all together.,0
"I have used personally. I love it man, I can say a lot about it.",2
Just a replica of Twitter it looks as if they just copied the source code for Twitter and used that and basically nothing is different,0
Clean experience,2
Very nice 👍,2
Good app,2
"Totally blank feed after following several top accounts. App just seems broken and doesn't do anything. No messages appear, no content. Searching for users works and following them works. But there are no feeds whatsoever after adding them.",0

This app is good. Alternative for twitter. Have u tried Threads app,2
It's an amazing app.,2
so bad,0
"Downloaded it, synced all the pages I follow and it worked great.  Fast forward a couple of hours and none of the pages I follow are in my feed.  Not a single one.  I get suggesting  pages I may like, but come on.  Deleted.",0
wow nice,2
Love it. But does it come in black (dark mode)? 😂,2
We need to text messaging option in there 😭,0
Not as good as Twitter it's similar to Instagram,0
"Twitter is better, and this app is horrible. Threads deserves 1 star because it’s boring and not the same as Twitter. Also I don’t think we really needed a twitter clone. Tbh I think we have enough social media as it is LOL. Also why leave or delete twitter when you literally have the biggest following on twitter. Also, for all the people that are trying to leave Twitter because you're too soft to deal with people, grow up LOL. Every social media app has bots and annoying people. It’s literally the internet; if you don’t like it, get off. Threads literally has the same thing as Twitter that’s why threads are implementing rate limits on the app now. Also, If you are leaving Twitter because of Elon Musk, well... I would rather trust Musk than the person who can’t keep data safe and also has privacy issues on their app. At least Musk hasn’t been to court for mishandling millions of people's data. A lot of people forget about what Zuckerberg has done with our data.",0
great app. plz increase thee word limit,2
Ok,2
"""Translation"" option please. IG and Twitter has it so why Thread fell short?",1
Thanks to Instagram for beating Twitter by creating this beautiful application,2
App is refreshing but I'm encountering crash whenever I try to thread on a thread.,1

Excellent,2
please change the feature where we can delete our thread account without deleting the Instagram account.,0
Same to same Twitter,2
It's a good app for spending some of your time without losing the track of time and waste more time like in Instagram and YouTube. It is starting so it is not perfect I think it should have reel s and all plus it should have personalized content because a lot of content I see on thread I don't even care about so they could improve this with updates. It is smooth and not laggy like Twitter with which it is competing. But privacy is a problem because meta is not good privacy,1
Good app,2
Garbage app.,0
"The app works well, but I don't see myself using this at all until there is a way to see only what I want to see, in a chronological order. Or at least limit it somehow.",1
so far it's a dope app. better than Twitter fo sho,2

Very happy,2
sucks,0
Good app,2
"I started by searching “Threads” in the app store, scrolled through some small apps unfortunately also named Threads (RIP to those, inevitably), and clicked on Threads by Meta. The app asked me to connect my Instagram account to sign up, and I switched over from my personal to my professional page – sorry, readers, I will not be revealing my finsta here. Et voilà, I became a Threads user.",2
It's amazing,2
So forced to see a whole bunch of people I can't care about and the amount of personal data the app wants is positively asinine.,1
Cool interface,2
"bug ,",0
Nyx,2
❤️🎉,2
Nice 🙂👍,2
"I don't really see the appeal of this. Yeah it's a rival to twitter and whatnot but for now, it doesn't look too promising. Boring interface, no option for what's shown in our feed, no explore or trending page, even no hashtags. The moderation system works though, and the filters are good unlike twitter where it's way less moderated there. But overall twitter is still a better app in my opinion.",1
U can,2
Better than Twitter,2
"Sending friend requests is buggy... For some reason, it sent MULTIPLE notifications to all my contacts Would have been nice to inform me that I couldn't DELETE the account without also deleting my Instagram account... beforee i signed my soul away.",0

"I hate that we need to login with an Instagram account. I don't want an Instagram account, poorly developed!!! The proper way to develop this is by creating a main Meta account, and using SSO to login each app. In your Meta User settings, the user should be able to choose which apps their Meta account can access, so they should be able to activate or disable FB, IG, Horizon, and Threads.",0
𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭,1
Works well! Missing a few features tho,2
Not bad,2
Threads is honestly WAYYYY better than twitter this is one of the best apps made. You dont have to find followers its just everyone you already follow!,2
Wow Excellent,2
How it's login without Instragram & If I forget my Instragram password,0
"Quite honestly ... what makes me sour ... is that I can't delete the app, I have to delete my whole Instagram account. And why do you need ALL my personal information made available to you?",0
Good,2
"Okay so far needs to fix some issues. I'm sure they are already hearing about all of the features that are missing but I'm actually having issues with gif uploads. When I upload a gif it glitches bad, turns it green and purple with 4 overlays of the same gif",1

A very good App,2

it works,0
Useless app,0
"Chaos on screen .. messages are overlapping to each other, unreadable.. bad bad apps.. still a billion mile away from twitter..",0
"Due to all the promo and advertising Facebook has done to promote this app, I decided to download this app yesterday night. Big mistake.

Getting onto the app, there’s literally nothing and I mean NOTHING go for it that’s new or good. It is literally a Twitter clone with stripped down features.

As for the community, once you’re actually in it you are left to ask, what community? There is none. Think about it; the majority of this app is insta users. If that doesn’t scream bad to you I don’t know what does.

But that’s not the worst part. Take one look at the data they collect or their ToS and you will faint. It’s literally a data miner.",0

I've only been using it for a day but so far so good. Feedback: the ability to save photos and post/reply with gifs. There's also no option to go through my folders in my gallery so when I pull up my gallery it's just all my photos and no way to access the different folders. The ability to sort the feed from either top or latest,1
"As other short-form thread based platforms sink like the titanic, Threads rises from their ashes. There is as of yet no paywall, no verification to boost yourself to the top, no post-viewing limit, and most importantly the platform has a zero tolerance policy for hate speech. The community is cool as a cucumber, the front page isn't flooded with hate and anger like it is on other sites. TL;DR: its well worth switching over.",2
This application has Censorship of opinion and does not allow deleting the account.,0
"Since most of the people have multiple accounts on instagram, I hope it will be possible to have multiple accounts in threads too.",1
Amazing,2
Way better than twitter,2
𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝,2
"So far, it's kind of a mess because you can't view only those you follow. Twitter still has that, so far ... I may not stick with this app if they don't let me curate my own feed.",1
Too early to tell what’s gonna happen with this app as a platform but never mind all that. The interface is like 1 degree off from being true black meaning those pixels are being powered on oled screens. Would be nice for you to get it to a true black for that power savings,1
Trying to create an account but when I get to the date of birth page I have to step through every month back to the month I was born in. That would be 800+ taps. Not going to happen!!,0
Still a lot of improvements to make. But it's looking fast with great UX so far.,1
Try krke batata hu 🇮🇳🙍🏼,1
"I give it two stars because the application is good but if you want to delete your account you also have to delete the Instagram one and it's annoying that you want to delete the access number on your profile and it comes out again and I think they have to fix that problem, because it is not fair that you delete your Instagram account for deleting the thread account.",0

Disappointing. I dumped Twitter when Musk took over. Wanted to join Threads but because I don't have an Instagram account I can't sign into the app. Deleting it shortly. Sigh! Truly disappointing. 😔,0
Too early for an objective review. But then just a few observations: -There is no option for dark mode on the app -You can't interact with the DP of Threaders,1

Just for fun........................... I like it,1
"Give us the option, or just eliminate it completely, to turn OFF seeing posts on our feed that aren’t from who we follow or shared from them.  These “suggested posts” take over the feed and you can’t see what/who you want to see.  I finally found the setting on IG to pause this for 30 days and I saw so many posts I missed for who I actually follow.   

Make it a setting; make it like IG, or heck make it like Twitter where there’s a tab to see just who you follow. 

As it is now, I don’t think this app is for me with all the garbage forced into my feed",0

"Stop forcing cross-platform user profile sync. I get your business model is to build data models of each of your users, but stop trying to farm me at every single faucet of online activity. Just allow a simple username/password to create an account instead of forcing users to sync from Instagram.

"First off: too many permissions needed. You don’t need my financial info, health & fitness info, search history and “sensitive data”. 

Second: it’s hard to find anything worth following because of all the unrelated mess you have the wade through. Always seeing content, even if it’s not related to me, is bad. 

Third: no real way to sort by new, or to only see you your followers.",0
"100% unusable, the posts and texts on the timeline overlaps (like constantly scrolling & overlapping the post like hundred times) make it not even readable. Bugs? super bad UI? not fully developed app? IDK, I'm using Android OS 9, ram 6Gb, maybe they develop the app for the newer version OS first. Unfortunately i can't send a screenshot. Anyway, completely inoperable, uninstall immediately.",0

If you download and get an account and after you tired of this app then you wanna delete your account it may affect your Instagram account i mean if you delete your threads account you will also lose your instagram account too so if you don't want this happen uninstall your threads 😌,0

Threads is a copy of Twitter. Nothing new. I have a idea for something that better than Twitter.,0
"It's Good but I feel like it's going to need a little more to compete with Twitter. For example This app also needs a trending page similar to Twitter. You could also include something else that is original. I feel like it could have a little bit more to it. I know it just came out a couple days ago, but there needs to be something added if this is going to keep the hype up around the app.",1
"User experience is very good compared to Twitter, but some features are missing, for example I can't on my profile people I m following, and I also can't see others following list, hope this feature will arrive soon, and the logo of the app is not looking professional.

I'd prefer it to be a standalone platform, it feels like you're being forced to put all your eggs in the Meta basket!",0
"The app is good, but it needs a lot of functionality. For example, when searching a topic, you don't find anything related to that topic, meaning anything that comes to you is via your main page, which incase lowers a lot of outreach and possibility of finding content that relates to you. Hashtags could called Threads and make it easier to find topics and such. Needs lots of work. It can be a good app, but it feels rushed.",1

The only problem I have with this app is you can't choose your username it automatically takes it from your Instagram. I feel like I was early enough to this app where I could finally get the username that I have on YouTube. Or even a username for my band. But I can't because Instagram....,1

It's great,2
"I love the potential of this app and can see myself use it more, but the only way that's happening is if my feed only shows me accounts I follow rather than having somewhat of an explore page on my feed. It's really content and information overload and we already have that with Instagram unfortunately - I don't think I can handle more without deleting one or the other. Please no ads or random algorithms, just a chronological feed of accounts I follow. Also surprised how hashtags don't work here?",0

"I love the simplicity of the app, it’s very clean and easy to use. Having said that it is lacking some features. It would be nice to have a live video function like you already have Instagram on Threads. The ability to edit text maybe up to 30 seconds after we post, something, more customizable, profiles, and allowing us to rearrange the bottom bar. I’m sure a lot of this is coming, but somethings need to take precedence. For instance, the direct messaging feature would be fantastic.",1

This is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?,0

I really like the theme of it.....lets wait and see how well it compares to twitter,1
"I’ve been using the app for a week now, and so far, I am liking it! The profile resembles it’s grahams old profile format. There aren’t a lot of features like it has on Instagram or other apps. where you could save drafts and schedule posts. I like how I’m able to connect with my Instagram followers through Threads, but you aren’t able to see who is mutually following you, or who follows you back. The overall layout of the time line is quite minimalistic, and reminds me of Tumblr in a way, so I eased into the format. I also wish we could change our usernames and names? I don’t want it to be just a copy paste from my Instagram. The switch account feature logs you out which is annoying. Overall, not bad!",1

I love this app<3,2
Most censored platform there is. Only what they want to be seen will and even if you are factually based and not vulgar you will still be censored. Awful.,0
"Already hate this app because they force you to view content you don’t follow or subscribe to. SO MANY ACCOUNTS forced on me in the first 5 minutes on the app that don’t match my views, beliefs, ideologies, interests, etc. 

Clearly the app is NOT about serving the user, but about force-feeding agendas one post at a time, and slid in the feed so you barely notice it. Sickening. I should have expected as much from meta.",0
Very good,2

I really like the app but I wish they could put an option where you can delete your account without involving your actual Instagram account. It's really a hassle.,0

I’m only giving it two stars for right now because I’m still learning about it. You know how you can connect multiple accounts on Instagram and kind of switch back-and-forth without fully signing out… Is there a way to do that with Threads? Like is there a way that I can also have Threads for my secondary/business account in the same way that we have them on Instagram?,0

The leaks of this app first appeared in April, which means it could only release stable later this year, but when they wanted to turn the troubles on Twitter into an opportunity, they released the app with many missing features.",1

So far so good I hope in the future there will be an option to see what are the trending topics on threads,2
I really like it!! Though I have a suggestion that could really help a lot of us users. Please add another option for following where we could only see the threads of the person we follow. I really don't like my feed as it's really messy and too much people I don't follow. I wasn't really interested at all. Plus it's also hard to see my peeps threads because of those unnecessary threads at all.,2
Nice App👍,2

I don’t want to see random people or brands I don’t follow nor have mutual followers with on the tl that’s wack. Not even threads the people I follow are interacting with. Everything else looks cool but the timeline set up is just too much it drowns out the people I actually follow and makes the user experience not that appealing at the moment.,1

More useful and better than Twitter,2
"Great app!!! However, I am experiencing bugs from time to time that limits my usage of the app. 😔 Sometimes my timeline won't refresh, sometimes it displays that I haven't posted threads yet even though I have, and I can't browse my notification bar because they cannot be clicked and are grouped together. I'll try to uninstall and install again, maybe that way I'll have a better experience when using the app. It has a big potential!!",1

"Promising. However, there' s a very scary feauture that most are not aware of: deleting your THREADS account automatically deletes your Instagram account.

ehhh I would prefer if Threads was a bit separate from IG. keep it separate ie. ig private & threads public and to have the ability to change user name in Threads if possible. I prefer not to be connected-linked to IG all of it.,0

"Competition is okay, cheating is not",0
"This could be a viable alternative to Twitter but it has to start out strong. Make it clear viewpoint discrimination and harassment Will not be accepted, that there isn’t going to be out of control content moderation, and that people are given the ability to make private groups. But if the overblown fear of Disinfo and “hate speech” (which doesn’t exist) cause this to veer off course this could be just another mastodon",1

Good,1
My Instagram stopped working after I downloaded this app,0
Dont download if you will delete threads app it will delete your all instagram data ypur ig profile will be dismissed,0
I said it before and I’ll say it again. Stop letting companies profit off of your personal information and everyday interactions. We already did the Twitter and Facebook thing. It wasn’t good for society. Find another way—try Mastodon for real and get on a smaller instance. This is just a new drug for the current addiction.,0

This aap iss trying to copy twitter No hash tags can be used neither tranding just disgusting,0
So bad app,0
"It's full of spam of accounts I don't follow and are not even related to the ones I do, is extremely annoying to a post of one of my friends and another 20 of strangers, blocking and reporting should be easier and once done should automatically mute that person's threads, and above all is no dark theme, so far not liking it at all",0

"Good interface Nice design Looks like twitter. Cross of insta and twitter But lacks some features of twitter like Translations under threads, don't have trending page like twitter, Don't have short videos like in twitter, Don't have view button like on twitter which shows how many saw your tweets. Don't show features like retweets, quotes tweets, have in twitter.",1
Better than Twitter,2
"I like it but there are basic features missing (photo edits in thread, hashtags) and how about a user guide? We know not everyone has it but after the c r a p from twatter, let's make threads happen.",1
"Could be great if all pages loaded when you clicked on them. Sometimes they just don't. Posts usually don't load at all. And my biggest thing: if you follow someone on Threads, you automatically follow them on Instagram as well. Either they're two separate apps or they're not. I would really like to be able to have a different list of people I follow on each app.",0
Garbage. Fake social media. Predetermined popularity. No useful functionality.,0
Badhiya nice,2

"First impressions were that Threads was a much nicer experience than other social media platforms however as time went on (24 hours) my feed started to become inundated with crypto scams, nudity and racist content. Expecting this to be dealt with, I flagged to the content moderation team only to be told that this sort of thing (hard R, crypto scams) were not against the rules and would not be removed. 
If this is the policy then I’m afraid the site will quickly become just as toxic as the others. Such a shame as it has such potential. I wish them all the best but if there is no rule against hate speech, nudity or scams, it’s not something I want to be a part of.",0
I do not like that if you enter Threads and you want to try it out or look how it looks like you log in. Then people want to delete their threads account but you can't. If you want to delete it you have to delete your instagram account and it's stressful.,0
I tried to create account on Threads and it requires you to have an instagram account. What if I want to create a handle independent of my social network accounts? Deleted.,0

"From the stunning visuals to the endless array of creative and engaging and interact with people, Threads is perfect for those coz has it all. Also the layout is perfect designed, the functions and options are good developed l. Feed personalization could be better... Pls check it's not good like Instagram .. In short thread is awesome than the twitter😀 Regards from, Zanzibar, Tanzania🇹🇿, East Africa",2
"While it is similar to Twitter, it is not exactly the same. Threads has a lot to offer and at the same time a little too much. I don't require the threads of people I don't follow and also has some security issues like it is possible to upload explicit images publicly and offensively criticising the threads but at the same time it diversified our opinions. It can be added as an extension to insta, which can make it more user friendly and if used appropriately it is a great app opportunity",0
Wow,2
Nice app but don't involve Instagram app into this. If we combine both will start ignoring another one,2
Not too bad so far it feels a little barren in comparison to some other websites and apps but it has potential The quality control and filtering need some work And i'd like more control over the timeline of stuff I see but it's a start,0

"Only one account? So much for businesses being able to use it. It's 2023, you would think that this feature would be one of the first things added.

Very nice 👍 🙂,0

UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.",1

"Well I hoped that it was like Twitter where you can post NSFW artworks but unfortunately it isn't like Twitter so I don't think it can replace Twitter anytime now.

"My biggest problem with Twitter is that it has no “edit” button and I am an impulsive commenter. This appears to be the case with Threads. For me, Facebook will always stand out for having this great feature. Sometimes, I deliberately post shabbily on the App just to capture the musings. Knowing that I can always come back to flesh out what’s been wrongly done kind of endears the App to me. Mark Zuckerberg must quickly afford us this feasibility on the Threads.",0

If this issue doesn’t get sorted out soon I’ll be on my way out. If threads wants to be a real competitor to twitter they need to fix the feed.",1

"I like to use new apps simply for technical curiosity. Since this is meant as a Twitter competitor, my comparisons are going to based on its features

Pros: Signup was a snap since it directly took my information from Facebook and Instagram. 

Cons: There are obvious missing features that Twitter has:
1 There is no institutional integration with other sites to direct users to Thread feed
2 No direct messaging 
3 No way to organize Thread followings to given topics (e.g. sports Threads in a feed)
4. The feed puts topics that would not appeal to me. Why didn’t include this knowledge from FB/IG?
5. No integration with FB/IG
6. No way to remove suggested Threads from feeds. 
7. No way to taylor ads to my desires
8. Nothing new or innovative compared to Twitter, Parler, et al.
9. None of my Followers on FB/IG directly transferred to Threads. 

Bottom line this is a me-too Twitter app, that I question would be its value proposition long term. If one really desires this type of social app, just sign up to Twitter.",1
The apps is outstanding broo,2

It's only just launched so I think we should give it a chance to grow but there's virtually no customization. You can't limit your feed to only accounts you follow and you can't create or filter your own feed via hashtags or keywords. This makes for a very bland and homogenized platform. The feed feels disorganized and strewn together with things I don't care about and don't find interesting. I would much prefer something that could be configured and adjusted to my own tastes.,1
Good job,2
I don't even want to give one star After downloading threads my account is been hacked So never download this app The worst experience of this app 🙏🙏 i could not even find my account 😔 lwra app,0
"You seriously require a connection to Instagram in order to even use this?

So much for a stand-alone social media competitor to twitter.

 Frankly this app is dead on arrival with this Instagram profile requirement.

Just another poor decision by The Zuck.",0

"Has potential but also has some issues. So I can see this platform becoming very fun to use in the future but it has some glaring issues.

"This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.",0

Good application,2
"With a multitude of auto-playing videos right off the fly of the homepage, it's really difficult to focus on the ""Threads"" that're meant to be the defining feature of this platform. This is basically just Instagram, but with a higher character limit. The unnecessarily large size followed by the lack of data saving features makes this app pretty redundant considering the existence of Twitter.",0
Don't Copy Buddy,0
Just created threads account. And I love it's user interface 👍,2

Pretty okay app. It’s the first day and I’m sure they rushed it out the door but really doesn’t feel like a replacement to Twitter though it is still a good addition to Instagram. I like the idea of everything just being public but the trending tab on Twitter and curated conversations are nearly impossible to find. Anyways wish you the best lads.,1
I love it so far!,2

Cannot find any way to restart a video or start unmuted. Annoying trying to unmute as you scroll.  Any way to rewind or start without mute????,0
"Zuck, my boy…if we’re gonna rake in the legal trouble by “mimicking” or grabbing “inspiration” from the bird next door *wink wink* let’s go ahead and stick to what works. Please, I beg you, fix the video playback on this app. Let’s grant users the option to disable auto-play, let’s add a scrolling tool so we don’t have to sit through the whole video or (God forbid) have our fingers slip and start the video all the way from the beginning, and let’s fix that pesky/stubborn audio enable button. 

Also, let’s update the U.I. a little bit. It’s giving: bland. Let’s add some pizzazz! I enjoy seeing what threads my friends reply to, but I also wanna see what they like. 

Lastly, the search tab…have your team take some notes on what Bluey’s doing to make things interactive (i.e. “For you”, “Trending”, “News”, etc.) and move forward from there. Thanks buddy.",1

The app overall is great to begin with but needs improvement. I am excited to see what meta does in the next couple of weeks!,1
This was definitely needed as Instagram had become boring. Only request would be to make this app available in parallel apps so that people with more than one account have easy access and won't have to login and logout everytime,2

"At first glance this app seems like an amazing mobile application. I’ve always enjoyed Instagram and I’ve always enjoyed Twitter. However, once you install this app, you will realize that you can never delete your threads account. Unless you delete your Instagram account also. For some reason, Zuckerberg and the Instagram meta-team think it’s a good idea to grab all of your health data, political, affiliations, religious beliefs, and even your credit score. Now on top of that, if you install this app due to all of the data mining that it is stealing behind the scenes, this app will drain your battery faster than any app that I’ve ever seen. So a reminder, this app is like hotel, California you can thread in anytime you like, but you can never leave.",0

Any potential thia app once had may have been wasted. Meta clearly rushed this app out the door without giving time to plan out and release updates at a good rate. It is ridiculously hard to grow on the app or see posts your actually intrested in. They don't even have an actual discovery tab or following tab. The apps been out for weeks now and has had virtually no changes. The lack of updates has killed any fun this app once had.,0

"If this app is gonna be better or at least equivalent to twitter it needs a few things. 

- Followed Users Timeline (this is the biggest one)

- DMs??? Meta has Messenger, why is there no integration or a built in DM feature?",1

"A rather easy to use app, everything seems pretty intuitive. However, the feed layout is a bit weird. I want there to be a way to only see accounts you follow in addition to algorithm recommendations, and there needs to be a way to see the most recent Threads rather than just the top ones",1
"The home page needs a huge adjustment. There's no logic to the content I'm seeing. There needs to be a way to cater what you're seeing. I only want to see the people I follow, that's why I follow them. It's a mess. Additionally, there's essentially no data privacy, so be weary. Also....you can't delete your account? What a misstep.",0

"A real sense of community without spam, nudity, and general content you do not wish to see. There may be a sacrifice of my anonymous data being sold to corps, but I am getting exactly what I want so I don’t care. Peace and tranquility and a sense of community is what I was attempting to find on other apps, and this is the first one. It’s a conversation! It’s not an argument. It’s not spoon feeding me videos all day as I scroll past over and over again. This is a new way for me to interact with people of my interests without being bombarded with outside influences. 

Nevertheless, there is still a great mixture of conversations you can randomly begin to be a part of that may not be of interest. 

This is the gen z app where inclusion is of the highest priority, and community is cherished.",2

Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved.

The fact that I can't delete my thread account without it also deleting my entire instagram is awful. I feel trapped. Separate them! Wish I had known this before I downloaded it. There's already bots and ads... I don't love it. It's also crashing every time I try to view replies to my threads...,0

At least one thing is true! We need a platform that is only text based social space! Threads and Twitter both are evolving into a multimedia platform - which is not really unique! Y'all still can be unique and don't mix it up!,0

"Hey bbg, 5 stars. However, please make switching between more than one account a thing (so i can have my public and private threads) and make a follower and following list there so i can easily sort through who i want to follow and who i dont.

"It's okay ,But not good as Twitter, i definitely know that only the "" Instagram"" users will use this app , The twitter user were not interested to use this app , this app only get the numbers of members but not the regular users, This app didn't gives us an interest to use the features, It doesn't have ""DM's , Hashtags and it doesn't differ the media and threads like Twitter does . It's a major issues to use this app. By the way , many people are using this app but it doesn't keep like this",1

"The amount of data this app requires from users is absurd. And the fact that you can't delete your threads account without deleting your instagram is horrible! The app itself is mainly text. If you're joining as a Twitter alternative, don't bother. You can't even search posts. There are no hashtags. I already want to delete threads just because of the extreme data mining. Europe has blocked it for those exact reasons.",0

ITS FOR CONVERSATION AND SHARING IDEAS ONLY. EASY PEACY. Cause what's the point of adding more things, it's gonna get like twitter in the future or later on instagram. I mean, there are already apps for that, let's separate things. I do agree that it could have an option of seeing feed from everyone and another of followers.",1

"The thread number will not leave my bio and I really don’t want it on there.

I try to hide the number, but it always pops back up when I refresh. I am very upset about this.",0
The app is great amazing well optimitized and very well running but I would like to see other features added such as dms and views on your threads if they do that it would overtake twitter in a matter of days otherwise great app,2
"Trash, if you are looking to see a Twitter killer, Sorry to disappoint you. It's been 3hours, trying to post a Thread but it's been crashing, and it ignores the threads of those you are following and shows you the posts of people it wants to. Lacks most of the features that makes Twitter lovely e g Hashtags, Threads is simply a crashing, bug filled Instagram. I didn't mention that it is data consuming and would advice you only use it on a Wifi that is not yours. In general it's a rubbish app.",0

It's good app But it should have some features like when i post any thread it have option like 1. Post to public 2. Post to public + friends 3 post private. Then definitely thread app will overcome Twitter 👍🏻,2

"I was scrolling on my feed liking posts when I suddenly got banned for ""spam"" despite never even posting, only liking posts. I tried to contest the ban but then the app completely froze for multiple minutes. I restarted the app and now it just says there's been an error. I even deleted and redownloaded the app and it still has the same message that I cant escape. there's literally nothing I can do. I'm just glad I made the account with a new instagram and not my personal account because if my actual instagram got banned for no reason I would be even more mad. On top of this, the app itself is like they combined all the worst parts of twitter and instagram, and left out anything good. The feed is clogged with posts accounts from accounts you don't follow, there's no post notification tab, no translate button, you can't select text, you can't search for specific posts, interface is cluttered, I could go on.",0

"It’s Twitter, but instead of being run by Elon Musk, it’s run by Facebook. The main feed is all people I don't know or follow, “influencers” thirsty for #engagement, and #brands trying to be clever or cute. No thanks. No hashtags, terrible search, and Instagram moderation is terrible. Also, you can’t delete your account if you sign in with your Instagram account without also deleting your Instagram account.",0
Stiff 1:1 scrolling makes this essentially unusable as a modern social media app. Just use regular Android scrolling.,0

Why is the treads account linked to your Instagram account? It's so annoying. This should be the user's choice if they want an account on threads or not. Meta really needs to change this.,0

What an awful service. I’m flooded with garbage threads from companies and folk I don’t know or want to know. And there’s no option to tell the app to only show me thread from the folk I follow. Don’t bother with this app until they fix this.,0
So nice apps,2
"As a photographer, not having access to create posts from the desktop is crippling to sharing images that originated in the big camera.

The app “feed” seems to be lots of stuff I don’t care about from random people. I would like to see a chronological feed of posts from people I follow.

The app UI is clean but bland. More photos would help.",1

"There are limited features as compared to Twitter, which is what it's trying to be, but overall, it isn't poorly designed frankly wish there was more of a ""recommended"" feed or other features akin to twitter that goes beyond who you follow on instagram.

"as of right now, threads has a good foundation and has the ability to grow and expand! obviously there’s room for improvement and many key features that people want are missing, it’s clear that future updates will come through and hopefully make threads a great, polished social media app. 

personally, i’d love to see the inclusion of a ‘people you follow’ timeline, bookmarks, the ability to see quotes on a thread, messaging and group chats, and more personalization on profiles such as location and a header. i think that with those additions (and others of course), people will begin to prefer what threads will have to offer and make the switch!

thank you for making this app and i can’t wait to see where it goes in the future! :)",1

"Threads is already a hugely better app than the dumpster fire that Twitter has become under the South African Blood Diamond heiress, space penis builder, and exploding car maker. It seems to operate smoothly, but there’s still a feeling of difficulty on how to post and repost like it is at instagram. I’m not sure if the hashtags are going to be as awkward either, as in more geared towards marketing than trending topics. This would all be easier to navigate if the app wasn’t showing up so small — basically smart phone size — on my tablet. I mean, I can just switch to my phone,  but yeah it bugs me when the size won’t integrate smoothly to the size of the screen. Otherwise, it’s a good app, and will likely replace Twitter in my social media time. Hopefully the size of the app to screen ratio is figured out quickly. I’m happy they provided a functioning app that’s not forever in beta.",1

I love this app,2
"Yes, the app is excellent. My experience with this app has been fantastic. I know it's a new challenge for Twitter. Here are my suggestions for the next update: 1. I highly recommend adding a scheduling feature. This would be incredibly useful for creators like me to plan and schedule their Threads in advance. 2. Another suggestion is to incorporate a direct messaging (DM) feature. This would enable users to have private conversations within the app.",1

I wonder why this feature was not added onto Instagram instead than a separate app though? Many of Instagram’s users will probably be hearing this app around and have probably been asking for the text post feature for a while now, such as a myself. I hope to see this app do well and maybe even as an addition to Instagram than its own separate thing. I would do anything for text posts on Instagram.",1

The best app than Twitter now we can use this. Thank you 🙏🙏🙏👊🔥🔥🔥,2
So good easy to use. Can't wait for future updates including trends/ hashtags and much more. The best Part is you can post upto 500 characters ♥️,2
"Terrible. Because of Instagram's overly cautious account policy, I think Instagram itself treats Threads as a 3rd party app and because of it I've been getting constantly logged out of Threads as well as Instagram despite they are designed as intertwined apps. This is such a huge failure on Meta's part yet again. Please fire the development team of Instagram and stop with overly cautious log in policies.",0
I feel like you guys should an inbox. It will make it better,2
It has potential but they didnt fix what the issue was with twitter. You still can not edit a post after it has been shared. You also see a bunch of posts of accounts you are not following. Which defeats the purpose of trying to control the feed with things you chose.,1
"Super User-Friendly, Captivating and Interesting. Hate that its tethered to your Instagram so, if your Threads page gets diabled, so does your Instagram profile. but other than that, it's definitely a fun app & community... setting the bar vs twitter.",2
At the moment the app locks users into specific agreements and features with no way to opt out later. The environment ruled by policies that effect ordinary people's ability to share their hobbies as well.,0
"Doesn't work at all. I'm unable to check notifications nor my profile (""Sorry, something went wrong."" error). I also can't post anything (""Your thread failed to upload."" error). Additionally threads in feed are displayed randomly, threads from people i follow are almost impossible to spot in between so spammy, unrelated content.",0

"I'm partly a big fan of Threads. Very smooth interface, quick loading, and instantly compatible with my Instagram profile. However, there's a few issues. Firstly, not many celebs that I admire are on Threads yet - hopefully they will be soon! Secondly, I like downloading memes that people post on Twitter... But on Threads, there's no option to Save Image apart from to screenshot. Apart from that, Threads is a great app. I think I'll be moving from Twitter to here!",1

По суті це альтернатива твітеру. І зі своєю задачею типу писати пости і робити треди воно справляється. Але все таки є мінуси і як на мою думку не вистачає можливості завантажувати фото (як в тому ж твітері бо частіше всього я заходжу туди щоб скачувати всякі меми і фото з котиками) а також не вистачає гештегів. І хотілося щоб ця соц мережа була трішечки яскравіша :3. Надіюся з часом додадуть нові цікаві функції і ті про які я вже сказала.,1

As soon as I got this app my Insta quit working and hasn’t worked in like 3 days now. Is anybody gonna address this and do something about it? If I knew this was going to happen I would not have gotten this app!!,0
Decided to try this app out since I’ve heard others talking about it saying it’s a better Twitter. Started going through the people I follow originally on Instagram to find out that once I get off the app I’m not following them anymore. I thought it was a one time glitch until I’ve tried it four times and it stills says I need to follow. Not sure when the next bug fixes will be but it’s inconvenient. The overall look is clean I can see potential in the app. Not sure if a lot of people will use this app since there is already Twitter and to have two apps that are identical is beyond me.,0
Good app,1
"The idea of the app is fun. It feels like a safe space where people are sharing thoughts and ideas. There are a few bugs, sit crashes often and it has slowed down IG as well. But it's a new app. I'm not expecting perfection yet since it was only launched a week ago.",1

"But with a clearly defined class system. As a less than of low notability, I cannot have a blue check. If that isn’t enough, I must also acquiesce to a feed with lower neural activity which is curated to ensure I think mostly happy or compliant thoughts which ensure I support The Current Thing.",0
"Clearly the app’s audience is not focused on writing, as on art, design and photography as means of expression. It should be added that by its very technological structure, the priority of the conversations or threads is given to influencers, in some cases “hot babes” of which you usually can't say anything other than ""hot"" ""love you"" ""you are amazing"" or something like that (or at least the normal people). Some media (magazines, newspapers) may offer more topics of conversation, but it is still not clear what people who are not as focused on writing as they are on visuals might have to say about it.",0

"This is yet another virtue-signaling garbage app put out by Zuck, the kind of selling your data to Russians. It’s weird how quickly the righteous left has forgotten their rage-quitting of Facebook just a few years ago and is now flocking to yet another copycat app created by the great Cuckerburg. It’s kinda almost exactly like Twitter, minus most of the best features and full of Leftist Weirdo Smelly Communists that can’t stop talking about the president from three years prior. This entire organization is an embarrassment to tech.",0
"Haha another chat app, that is exactly what everyone needs... 😂",0
not download,0
What about those who don't use Instagram and want to use threads????? It just sucks,0
I’m ready to see what this app has to offer and can it truly be one of the next big apps. Stay tuned to see more coming up!!!,2

Usually when I try to repost content from instagram to threads it’ll freeze. Which is weird cause they’re too if the same app but it’s still fresh so I understand but hope this get solved soon. The link between IG and Threads is what makes thread more valuable then Twitter,1

Very use full app thanks Instagram,2
It's a great app but It would be better if I could switch accounts like Instagram. And I can't see how many people I follow. I would be grateful if these two things could be updated.,1
Best App,2
It's good so far but it need to add a little more features. Like for you thread and Follow thread. The threads need to be in order.,2
"It's actually really good and better than twitter, obviously I kinda expect y'all to keep adding to the app overtime, but my posts get no engagement at 0 followers. So that sucks. Also it is missing some things that I really wish it had, but when they add them I'll change my rating. Overall solid app and better than twitter 🤘🏼",1

Not gonna rate right now. Cuz the app literally just came out. Gonna wait a week at least.,2
This app is trying to be twitter. Imagine releasing an unfinished app just to try to take users away… I had the app for a good 25 min and deleted it. Why start fresh on an exact replica app when I have everyone I follow already there.,0

This is great I recomend it to everybody,2
Not bad at all,0
No added value from others,0
"This is a great concept for an app, especially with Instagram integration. The content AI/ algorithm seems very weird and the content given is unlike what my Instagram home page is like at all. Furthermore, for those who have two accounts (one personal and one public etc.) there is no way to switch between them seamlessly like in Instagram. I would really like that to happen. Thanks Meta team.",1
"Meta lied!! Threads doesn’t import all your IG followers. What it does is allow you to follow everyone you follow on IG with 1 button. If those followers don’t tap Follow All they wont follow you unless they choose later. More over if they follow you on IG after creating a Threads, they won’t follow you on Threads either unless they choose to. I was hoping for an exact sync of IG & Threads and was completely let down. If I continue on Threads after being lied to it will be with great reluctance…",0
"Overall features and UI is good but what I noticed in the app is after Posting thread, the no. Of threads we post is not there so I think it should be there. And no of followers and following tab should be there. And again the app is overall good.",1

My app keeps crashing when I clicked the reply.,1
The best app 🤣🤣👌,2
I do enjoy the layout of this app more then twitter. However I see to many posts from people I don’t follow and have no interest in following. So I think a page for recommended content separate from the content from people I already follow would be a good idea. I have noticed that the people’s content from who I follow appears first. 9/10,1
Had to uninstall this app as my phone started acting up after installing and using the app for two days. My phone kept on ghost tapping and scrolling or other apps would hang.,0
"Kya ghatiya app hai🤬 Ek bhi ladki reply nehi karti, ""DON’T INSTALL THIS APP""",0

Hello World!,2
There doesn’t seem to be a way to only view people I follow.,0

The idea of migrating over from Twitter was nice but I’d rather be there interacting and looking at tweets my friends share than over here where my entire feed is ads and accounts I don’t even follow. Taking a break til they decide to adjust this,1
Too much of glitch. Can't use The app at all as it glitches continuously.,0

"I will preface this by saying that I very rarely access social media; I use Snapchat for a handful of people and have a Facebook account for Marketplace. I am also NOT an Elon fanboy. The app is made very well, as Meta has quite a robust budget and talented programming team. Aside from that, I don’t like how the people you follow are shuffled between random check marks and that it’s unfiltered. Good for a basic, feed-central social media. With all that being said, this app will cause nothing but trouble. Elon Musk’s primary reason for purchasing Twitter in the first place was to divorce it from political power and fumigate the existing echo chamber. Less shadow-banning led to a more balanced ecosystem of opinions. Mark Zuckerberg, head of Meta which was known to sell user information and bolster an all around terrible support ticket system, is making a new “Twitter” right before an election cycle. I can’t wait to see how one-sided things shall be on Threads and not Twitter. I do not wish to continue using either app, however I feel as if a neutral opinion was warranted.",1

Can't remember the last time I got an app at launch and it was flawless. Bravo.,2
Amazing app. Much better than Twatter,2
First it’s a fake twitter run by someone who doesn’t even look real. Second we already have twitter. Third this app preforms terribly and has so meany bugs. Clearly a cash grab not meant to actually be good,0

Since threads launched I have been a fan. Cool app. However once I shared from the thread app into my instagram feed my instagram account can’t post with out it. I’ve deleted and reinstalled but it seems to be some flaw in the app. Anything I post from Thread to instagram is fine. Everything else I try to post from the app itself disappears. Please investigate and fix this.,0
Nice app,2
Need improvements,1
Good one,2
Super app mark sir,2
"what is wrong with having to press the speaker button if u want to upload a video huh?? the button is so tiny and most of the times users forgot to press that button... it's so stupid. Also, what is the purpose of following someone if we're gonna see random people's postings in our tl anyway?? Do not see where you are going with this honestly. Except for the smoothness of the UI, the UX is noticably worse than its' competitors.",1

🥰😍lovely App,2
Nice apps,2
Just wow,2
"so far, i am enjoying this app. obviously there are some features missing that i want, but it is good so far for it’s first update.

my one complaint about the current features though…the words i have hidden are still showing up on my timeline. this must be a bug, but it is a frustrating one, because there are certain posts i absolutely do not want to see and yet i’m still seeing them. i hope this can be fixed soon!!

otherwise, the algorithm seems much better to twitter, although it still needs some work. i’m looking for a following tab that hopefully i can make my default timeline, so i’m not seeing so many random accounts. i would also like a feature where you can switch between accounts easily, like on instagram, and i want their to be a close friends equivalent!",1
Useful 👍,1
Overall gives good experience and feels like Instagram nothing special about this app but gives you a feeling of newness,1
