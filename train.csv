Awesome..,2
This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook today,2
It's familiar to Twitter where the difference! But it made an ecosystem with Instagram and that's pretty good 👍 I'm searching for a differentiation to use thread.,1

Very bad,0
Really good and easy to access,2

Inability to easily switch between profiles makes this less useful than other options.,1

Good user interface.,2
Awesome app already. I love it,2
Seems to have a lot of similarities to Twitter which is great and integrated with Instagram also great. However the main issue I'm having is that I have multiple Instagram and Twitter accounts for different companies and personal accounts and there doesn't seem.yo be a simple straightforward way to switch accounts on threads without it setting off all of Metas security alerts and stopping me from switching accounts from within Threads itself.,1
Very Good App Better Than Twitter,2
🥰😍😍😍😍,2
"bekar app hai, kis ladke koo DM b nhi kr skta",0
Better,2
If switching to multiple accounts could be as easier as Instagram it would be convenient too,1
Copy of Twitter 😂😂,1
Force stop,1
Great,2
What?! Again videos? Should be only for text and photos!,0
Enough of the algorithms. I just want to see what my friends posts in a chronological order without seeing a bunch of strangers who I don't know or care about.,0

Pwoli sanm,2
Nice App i love it from the first 5 minutes,2
It will automatically exit the program,1
I read the privacy policy and this is not a separate application. It’s connected to Instagram and you can’t delete a Threads account without deleting the Instagram.,0
Have a good one,1
Amazing,2
Consuming more time !!😑 Not user friendly UI,0
Ok,2
Good one,2
I’m done with twitter,2
Stupid app useless,0

"Trash, I got to have an Instagram? I never used that pedophile trash app!",0
Threads threaded tweeters😂😂,1
Yeah this sucks. Where's the NSFW artist where's the fun in that? I believe it's going to die quickly like NFTs I just don't want the servers to die down from Twitter. I have a great time on Twitter than this I don't even think of. They'll update later wish they probably won't because the creator who made this is an idiot that doesn't have one for PC which ruins the purpose of what Twitter and Instagram have,0
"i love the ui , its really cute and clean/neat to use! really gives me the familiarity of Instagram too!",2
I'm enjoying this app 🤝,2
It's glitching just when I logged in my account,0
I hope it will surely be reasonable for the entire human world.,2
Good ui,2

Best,2
Worst app ever,0
i install this app with many excitement but after seeing too many glitches i am very disappointed💔,0
i care about facebook fixing it’s “dating app” features. i care about facebook fixing the app so when i delete my dating account and wait the several days the icon should be there. i don’t care about this invasive stupid twitter prototype,0
"There is a lack of Messenger in this, if the messenger was in it, it would have been better. It would have been a very good app, but if there was a messenger, I would have given five stars. That's it for now.",0
It's better than twitter 😂,2
Wohoooo!!Just Launched in India🥳,2
Ver nice 👍 app,2
bad,0
"Installed to check it out, saw there was no way to filter by people you follow (seriously, that's a pretty basic feature). Super bare bones imo and really no different from Twitter and that includes the toxicity. I stick with Mastodon and the fediverse.",0
I love this app so far! Please come out with color themes and increase the size of the profile picture. Or a way to customize your personal page. Twitter won’t stand a chance!,2
Trust me W twitter,2

"The app is great, but it is lacking a key feature.

The app needs some way to only see people you follows posts",1
Its a copy of Twitter .,1
Very very very good,2
Awesome,1
Poor,0
"Ok so I’m liking what I’m seeing for a first version of this app. I definitely think it has the potential to be a serious Twitter competitor. But it’s really barebones. 

It’s missing hashtags, a trending page, and search. These things are like the essentials for a discussion app lol. It’s ok because the app is still new, but these features should come out ASAP.

Some other features we could use are bookmarks, and a way to see past likes. We should be able to have more control over who appears on our feed. Plus some UI improvements, but that will come with time.

If y’all can get these features out I think it’ll be an awesome competitor to Twitter. We’re rooting for you 🧵",1
Where are massinging button,1
It's not displaying any posts. Not even off people I follow,0
"I'm no bot. App is horrible. And as I heard, I posted right away and was censored, everyone was right.",0
Best so far,2
"Surprisingly really nice. Not going to lie. But the image and video quality is so bad. Like the compression is so so so terrible. If that was changed and we could have better video and image quality it would be so much better <33 please add that lol otherwise its actually really nice. Also having a ""following only"" browse feature would be so cool too 👍👍 new feature req. Being able to switch between mult accs!!",1
Pretty cool app Amazing features I loved it,2

"I started to enjoy this app until Meta started restricting my instagram actions for no reason. More than a year, I’ve never been action blocked on Instagram until I became more active on Thread. My main issue is why should you action block my instagram account instead of thread because thats where I mostly engage. This makes me conclude that the link of thread to Instagram is bad",0

A Twitter from thrift shop.,0
Yes ❤️👈 you too,2
This app is so much better than twitter! There is way less hate and a lot less chaos. The atmosphere is not toxic!!,2
What's the point of launching it as a mobile-only app? Stealing data? Lack of a proper web app is a major turn off for me.,0

This app so good and smooth run in my phone,2
It's a clear ripoff of Twitter and Truth social. Alot of censorship of free speech to protect snowflakes who live in mommies basement shooting up redbulls and twinkies.,0
It's better Twitter,2
The seamless integrations between Threads and Instagram was such a smart move. Creators would be WAY less motivated to.,1
Nice app,2

"Not a very good app. Just people self promoting and saying dumb things. They also don’t let you delete your account, and if you delete the app you can’t delete the badge from your Instagram account if you delete the Threads app so you’re basically a permanent advertisement…",0

Still checking 😁,2
This app is so nice and sweet like Twitter,2
"It’s only day 3 and I’m already exhausted from scrolling through a feed of random verified accounts that I’ve never shown interest in or interacted with. I was really hoping that this app would allow me to view content and posts that I actually wanted to see, rather than copying every other social media and constantly forcing me to view videos and posts from accounts I’m not concerned with. 

If there is one thing social media needs, it’s the ability to truly see only what you follow. There are enough ads and suggested posts based on data sharing as it is. Please remove the feature that allows any and every account access to your feed",0
Threads community is hands down the best I have been a part of.,2
Time to uninstall Twitter😅,1

Just a cool app not like twe***,2
Kicks me off everytime I post something. Considering how bad the Facebook feed has gotten over the last month it shouldn't be a surprise. At this point I'm wondering if they screwed Facebook up on purpose to send millions of set up Facebook users over to their other platform.,0
Nice app tho,1
Not good 😓😡,0
I Love it so far✌🏾,1
Crazeeyyyy,2
Good,2
"We need freedom of speech, DM options, hastags and trending topics.",1
okay so when I first went on the app I clicked to make an account with my insta. it showed my most of my friends that have the app but I clicked off of it by mistake. now I have to manually follow each of my friends instead of having a easier way to find them,1
I would give a 5 if you'd let me sign-up without requiring us to have Instagram.,1
Follow @izuahf,2
I like it but it does need some improvements like more private settings like there should be a option to hide my replies from people while having my profile in public simliar to the twitter circle like that,1

The app is great but it's also fun*king annoying one minute I can follow someone the other minute I can't Sometime I can't even post really had a rough time with it but I love the app that's why I'm giving it 5 star please fix the issues And another thing it keeps blocking me out of the app some times saying we restrict so so nd so something like that pls fix the app,2
We want dark mode on threads. Add this feature in next update.,2
"Cool App Better Than Twitter Its Easier TO ""USE"" BUT It Has Some Problems Like You Cant Use Hashtags",2
"So you select who you want to follow, refresh the feed, and it shows a ton of accounts that aren't even close to who you follow, and the timeline isn't synced up so you'll be scrolling back and forth. What a waste of a potential Twitter replacement.",0
Jai shree ram ⚔️🗡️💪🔱🚩🇮🇳,2
Nice but add a trending page and hashtags,2
"It's smooth & i love the fact that Threads have no theme colour, it's just white or Pitch Black. And, well for now it's in need for major upgrades. The settings ui, thread pinning, over-all experience. The point is, how different it is from Twitter & Instagram.",2
People don't understand that this app is just launched recently so it will take some time to get more features. It'll become very popular medium of expressing own thoughts in the future,2
Please edit the hashtag features,0
This app is not made of ipad. I think they need to make one because twitter has there own version for ipad.,0

"although it’s still a new app, i’m confident this app will be in my top 3 most used apps within the next couple weeks.

instagram is a fairly run, pretty good app all things considered. it has a decent moderation system (still a couple inconsistencies) and the layout is generally pretty cute.

i’m already liking the layout of this app, although i hope sometime soon they add a dm feature. i know instagram already has dms but i think it would be easier to share threads with people through dms via threads. 

great for how quickly it came out though!",2

Zuck is my darling. He can have my data instead of Twitter,2
Threader is great but not perfect yet. Here's what @zuck needs to fix ASAP. → DM: allow us send direct messages on Threads. → Insight: we need to see analytics to measure growth → Cover: we need cover photos in our bios for proper branding → Quote Threads reader: we need to be able to see the quotes on each post → Media: Allow us check out only media on profiles (e get y). What else have you noticed that's missing that needs to be fixed ASAP?,1

"Love the app already. The integration with instagram when creating your account is smart. Whole communities are finding each other. However, there are some caveats:
1. I can’t switch accounts easily like I can with Instagram. I operate a small business account and a creator account to boot and I have to hard log out of my personal account to switch. Please add switching functionality please!
2. GIPHY keyboard from iPhone does not work like it would on competitor apps
3. There is no chronological timeline or sort by feature. If there were buttons similar to Reddit or Twitter that lets you scroll between “new, hot, best, etc”, then it would make it fantastic to scroll through",1

The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform.",0

I like threads better than twitter because you can find your instagram friends on there and directly see everything. On twitter everyone has secret accounts and its not easy to find people in real life twitter account. I never got into twitter because of how confusing it is to find everyone and to find the right account that interests me. With threads everyone who im following on instagram is there & it makes me feel comfortable,2

"so far, i like threads. it’s pretty solid for now, it can be better. that being said, i do have some suggestions for the app developers to improve the app for users: 

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!
only the ppl i follow and their activity should be in my timeline, not these other random users…put them on a separate page
the separate page should be our home page with news, pop culture events, hashtags you follow, and the random users/suggested posts here
pls give us hashtags!
search by hashtags and words, not just users 
thumbs down for threads (dislike count not shown public)
pls give us a gif library in the threads post area
a drafts/save for later tab for threads
following count put by the follower count too. why is it just one? show both or neither, pls pick one
show list of likes + the option to keep it private
saved/bookmarks tab (private)
dms/private messages on here 
voice message for threads
close friends thread list
these changes would make a lot of people (including me) use the app a whole lot more and come back to give a higher review rating. we thank you for the hard work so far. and thx for listening!🩷",1

This app is better than Twitter,2
"The app is decent a lot of the time so far but for it to be great i think it should distance itself a little bit from instagram, still have the option to link it with insta but not rely on it entirely. 
I really think there needs to be more user experience to it like asap, dm’s seeing your own likes, allowing people to follow without needing to accept a request when you have a public profile, SAVING POSTS‼️‼️etc I really want all these things to be added/fixed like yesterday haha- oh also make it easier for people who follow a lot of people at once to not be assumed as a spam bot please :) cant log into my account anymore bc of that",1

"Solo pudiera competir con Twitter, si no tuviera tantas restricciones como facebook.",1
I really wish the feed would allow for me to see all posts from the ones I follow only instead of just seemingly random users… this should be an absolute priority or I feel this app is going to loose users fast. It’s not needed for me to see all random people in my feed… match what u have on insta already and this would be the bomb. Also I should be able to see what’s trending… in a way. Just to know in general what’s going on on the platform!!!!,1

App crashes when attaching an image. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9 and I've seen others even on iPhone report this issue but no official acknowledgement of it seems to have released. I hope they fix this pretty quickly because it's a bit annoying.,1
Good app but it's working against twitter so there is no improvement.,1
I like the app since you can share it to Instagram and also it is so high quality but one thing is that i want to see on my feeds like the accounts i followed seperate to those people who's using the app because for me only it's kinda messy. Or maybe im stupid to didn't know the meaning of the app well myself didn't like other people. I love yll,2

I feel that the app coukd be better like having a way to show me threads by the people I follow not just one chaotic mess of tweets and replies but I have hope this will evolve into something brilliant its definitely been a long time coming thank you,1
Since I downloaded the app I've tried posting and it constantly shuts down. All I can do is see people I don't follow/like/share things. 0/10 recommend. Going back to Twitter.,1

The only thing that's keeping me from giving this app Five stars is the fact that I can't post uncompressed photos that are larger than 10mbs at a rough guess. If I try to the app crashes or fails to post the image which is really disappointing,1
Best app,2
I regret I installed it. Horrible app discriminating Ukrainians. Linking Threads deletion with Instagram deletion is threatening and intimidating to users. Make an option to delete it!!!,0
MUCH better than Twitler's,2

"It's a good app. You can share anything, especially your current thoughts and whatnots. However, I suggest that there should be a choice of interests too so that the contents on home will be filtered with that interest. It will be much more fun to use it if people see what they actually like to see. Hoping for the improvement of algorithms.",1

"This app is good but i hope in the next update they add something that we can put back the ""thread badge"" on our Instagram profile, i removed the badge and realized its much easier for my friends to track my thread. Plsss add it so ppl can also decide to remove or put it back huhu",1

"I so badly want to leave Twitter forever but, aside from the fact that there are some glaring holes that seem likely to be addressed/fixed, this app has stopped working for me. The Activity area won’t load. Just says “Sorry, something went wrong. Try again”. Also, same thing happens when I click the profile button. Can’t see my threads or replies. Says the same thing here. Lastly, I cannot see replies on threads other than the ones that appear in the main feed. When I click on a thread, it says the same thing yet again (“Sorry, something went wrong. Try again”) where I would be able to see replies, etc. Lastly, I get the same error message when I try to post a thread. So frustrating!!!

I’ve tried logging out/in again, deleting the app, restarting my iPhone, and nothing works.

I have never liked Twitter UI and it's interfacing and now after using threads it's really app that can replace Twitter because in Twitter the pages load times are too slow and it's unreliable too. Thread is great 👍.,1
It's too Good,1
Forced to follow random accounts. No customization options. No lists or separate views. No sorting. Friends aren't floated to the top. No nsfw content. Your scroll placement isn't saved. The feed refreshes whenever you click anything and then you got random posts again. It's not a good app.,0
Nice,2

I'm at the point where its unusable in its current state. Needs a lot of work.",0

I love this app,1
"love it, just want a dim mode and more privacy options (such as being visible to both your followers and people you follow or being able to mark specific posts/replies and public) so engagement is easier and safer, rather than just being cut off if you're on private.",1
I'm the first review! This seems phenomenal! Look i only have one problem. I'm an influencer and when I logged in with insta I had 0 followers on threads while all of them on Instagram. You should have an option to keep the following same as it takes months to build it again and is very frustrating. EDIT : Get hashtags back!!,1
It's good app but theards that showed to me most of them or all of them belong to celebrities and influencers why normal people theards don't appear too it's all 🥲,0
Garbage app. Lasted 15 minutes on my phone before I uninstalled it.,0

"App used to work just fine, even though it was bare bones. After July 13 update, Threads links no longer load outside the app. Now it's impossible to share links with friends via text, unless they also have the app.
If this is a deliberate attempt to wall off user generated content, it's a hard no and permanent uninstall.",0
Twitter way better,0
"not a single person I follow shows up on my timeline, just 3rd rate influencers. no option to see only those I follow? also when replying, I can't see my own prompt, the keyboard covers it...",0

"It's have access to my very personal information, and it's not acceptable for a social application like this !!!!",0
Need improvement 😔 in this app Some time it's laging,2
After a sec of looking around I finally understand the app. You write and thread and people comment and interact with them. You link your Instagram to the app and you have your account. Try it out!,2
"Didn’t think I’d say this but I’m soooooo happy leaving Twitter and the vibe is already so much better! That said, we need a few things Meta: better support for Gifs and various forms of media. Audio file support, an iPad app - yes, you have to do this it’s important! And I’m sure I’ll think of more but great start so far.",1
I now installed and logged in but there is a bug inside the app looks the screen not stable and the writing shakes. So can't control it.,0
Nice,2
No trends.,0
"Its so fun actually, love it",2
Good app but copy of twitter,1
You cannot delete it unless you delete your instagram account too. The deep integration with instagram is perverse. It could have been a standalone app that does not require you to plug in into the metaverse by force but I guess that was asking too much.,1

"Correction: “Removed two stars because why bother having a follow button if you see everyone on the app. Unless I’m an idiot, there’s nothing to allow you see only the people you follow.” The app has a lot of potential and is very clean, which I like a lot. Both reasons why it gets four stars, however I do follow a lot of artists that don’t speak English and without a translate option it’s impossible to interact.",0
"I hope the security on this app will not be like that of Instagram, easily hacked. Else we will still go back to twitter.",0
I think 🤔🤔 this can beat Twitter,2

Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.,1
No thank you. Too much privacy requirements are taken,0
"So I guess I’m deleting my IG. Thanks for the encouragement to do something I’ve wanted to for years. Meta is just as f’d up as twitter, this is not a haven.",0

"I have hope they get this app to be something presentable, but the entire home feed is random people, not the people I follow. They threads also seem to be from random times.

Great app and a great competitor,2
"I enjoyed the onboarding experience of bringing in my Instagram followers. But then I was faced with an identity crisis. I’m a suburban mom on Instagram and an industry leader on Twitter. I don’t mix the two and it felt awkward. I trimmed some followers and found several Twitter friends.

I am irritated by the forced content from people I’m not following because it feels like I’m standing in the tabloid section of a grocery store. Facebook started doing this a few months ago and it drives me crazy. It is a constant stream of ads for brands and influencers I have no loyalty to. I understand that it makes the app more addictive and makes you feel like you have to constantly check it to stay up on the latest trends, but I quite Twitter because of this. I’m tired of hitting Mute and Block on Threads just to enjoy my feed of the latest trends in my industry. Let me curate my content and be intentional about what I consume. I really don’t want to know what Hollywood celebrities are doing. If this “feature” continues, this will be the reason I don’t use Threads.",1
Keep it up,2
Very good app,2
"at first I like it but I started having a problem. It keeps closing. I'm not even done composing my caption. I couldn't upload the photos that I wanted to post because it keeps on stopping. I refresh it, I log out and went online, I redownload the app but still I couldn't post what I wanted to post :<",0

"Within minutes of making a profile & integrating my IG, I started checking out the app. Way to many posts from people I don’t follow. There’s no way to disable reposts, that I can see. You know how contacts on your phone are there cuz of YOUR decision? Threads is NOT like that. You’re inundated by posts from people you don’t know. You spend more time blocking/scrolling past/muting accounts you don’t follow vs any content you have interest in (the people you follow)",0
"PLEASE make posts searchable instead of just accounts, either through hashtags or by searching for words that appear in the posts😭 also needs the ability to pin posts. its barely usable in its current state since i want to search for certain topics and be able to find people i dont already know. this feels like a total fumble since i could totally see myself using it as a substitute for twitter IF AND ONLY IF search functions were actually useful.",1

"Twitter lookalike minus some features like DMs, explore, views etc. Your feed will have more content from people you don't follow. Basically people/brands with the blue tick! The reach, algorithm must be on trial phase rn & won't be surprising if it favours influencers!

Where is elon musk review ?,0
Very Good App,2
"My fave bird app is no more so I signed up here. Since I don't like the main feed filled with people/accounts I have no interest in and do not follow and since Instagram already has it, can you please have it so we can see our Following and Favorites easier? Please also have an option to Save the thread like Instagram posts. Thx.",1
Great app and much better than Twitter.,2
Can't wait to get censored once again.,0
Excellent,2
This is a badly designed version of 2010 Twitter. Terrible design. You can not delete a threads account unless you delete your Instagram. It's like a forced relationship.,0
Nice apps,2
"The worst thing about this application is that it is connected to the Instagram account, and this is not a good thing, because you will not be able to delete the account until you delete the Instagram account, and this is bad, but very bad, even worse.",0
Can't even post anything it just exits the app,0
I need message like Instagram so I don't need to open other apps to share any threads,0
"Its just big business trying to write the narrative. Stupid, mainstream, censorship, big money, NSA",0

I liked the app . تطبيق جميل,2
Shiv ji is everywhere even in the logo,1
"So far my time on threads have been satisfactory. But this bad boy needs more features. Editing posts, saving photos posts, use of hashtags, direct messages, monetization, third party app linkage, logging without Instagram, and that's all I can say for now.",1
BETTER THAN TWITTER 😏🤣❤️,2
Good,2

"Just a bloody copy of twitter, It's the exact same thing but worse, Wouldn't recommend supporting these kind of clone apps",0
"You guys still impose the annoying auto play video on this app just like Instagram, the reason I don't use Instagram, how can you not give us option to turn off the feature? So annoying.",0
I really like it,2
Best thing about this app is staying close with my friends and family,2
I like it a lot. Especially in terms of a clean UI. But maybe if you can make multiple account choices and also the Pin feature,1
Same blue garbage app,0
It's overall a nice app. I really enjoy using this app.,2

The app is nice but it feels like a copy of twitter,1
"Sucks up too much memory off of my phone. And it's choppy, not fluid way to use it.",0
Am I really the first one in the world to write a positive review on this app!!! Love it! It's a love at first sight 🤩😍,2
Super but following nahin dikh rahi hai,2
This app is amazing my guys come here to Threads amazing app better then Twitter Twitter was in good hands before know with elon musk Twitter is in bad hands how does know how to handl social media So we have to leave Twitter,2
Good,2
Boom,2
How refreshing that there's a new app like this after Elon Musk ruined Twitter.,2
"Decent app with the most basic of microblogging functionality. Only big due to the brand name - had this been any startup, this would have been dead in the water. Lacks basic functionality such as a web interface and user sign-ups without having to tie an Instagram account. Block feature is also not working as you can still see the posts of a blocker user.",1
"Can you add the translation feature? Also, when I search for something I don't want accounts, I want threads or hashtags",2
This is amazing.,2
Just like twitter But benefit is to be a new and starter of the thread app,2
A best app rather than blue bird tweep,2
Better than Twitter the UI is so comfortable and good looking as it can share the same posts to Instagram and the story templates are so good looking ❤️,2
Good app,2
"Threads😍🫶❤️ Maza aagaya super, lode kijiye enjoy lijiye 😄",2
Please completed my 1 million followers,2
Will comment some other time . To early to rate,2
Reminder: i should not install this app,0
"First Impression of the app is good, but it would been better if there was a multi account login feature like in Insta and if it was connected with Insta with a user name instead of showing a number in the profile. And it will be better there will be option to like in Insta, by double taping.",1
It's just instagram again,0
Very competent but doesn't do well with the details,1
"Excellent app, 😍",2
No funciona en mi teléfono. Abro sesión y aparece una pantalla toda distorsionada. No se puede leer nada ni identificar ningún botón. No puedo hacer absolutamente nada. Nota: Con la última actualización el problema se solucionó y por eso mi nota paso de 1 estrella a 5 estrellas.,2

"Something went wrong. Please try again."" It keeps showing up after signing in with Instagram. After six hours still nothing to see what kind of app it is and what is going on there. Need your help.",1
"it's crashing a lot when I upload pics and refreshing my feed, my feed won't even refresh unless if it crashes",1
Love this new app!,2
"Information overload. I see a lot of post in the feed that I don't care about, just wanna see my favorites and maybe threads that people I follow reply on. It's a great concept but just way too much information in the feed and it's hard to process.",0
One of the best thread apps. Thanks meta❤,2

"This app was one of the more random apps that I ever meet, literally is a copy of Twitter but I think it can be fun use an alternative version of twitter just we need give a little bit of time to the app and meet it better, and see how many things the app can give us in the future.",1
"So far it's pretty peaceful. I appreciate that there's a pop up telling me that I might be posting something that could be deemed a problem(even if they're wrong), instead of the way FB will just arbitrarily ban me. I am getting a ""Threads failed to upload error."" This is annoying since other apps are uploading just fine.",1
nice,2
"It's a good app with a lot of potential, but for some reason I haven't been able to see my notifications or people's profiles (mine included!) since yesterday as it says ""something went wrong"".",1

"Don't make an account if you intend to delete it after because this app doesn't provide that. Once you make an account, you won't be able to delete the account completely without deleting your ig account. Home algorithm also meh, this app doesn't care to ask what your interests are. They just shove all accounts to your home even though you don't follow anyone. This app also put that @numbers to your bio, which annoying and can't be hidden. I really hate my decision to make account, deactivated",0
Good 👍,2
We need lists and DM's!,1
Very bad,0
It closes when I'm writing a post. My feed is too random. The post button should be top right. Please upgrade it better :) it's fun tho.,1
I used this app very useful app thanks #threads,0
Crashes when I try to upload photos. Haven't been able to share a single image yet. Will change rating if fixed.,0
"Well I downloaded the app only to find out afterwards that you have to have a Instagram account to log in, and there's no other way around that that I saw, so 1 star. If it's fixed, then I will re-review. I don't have Instagram and I'm not getting it either.",0

It's tied to Instagram... Uninstalled. I was hesitant anyway because of meta. Is finally woke me up Can't believe all the false positive AI generated reviews. Note: Im not a fan of Twitter.,0

"Yeah good, but a very little bugs are there otherwise its amazing!!!",1
"The app looks promising and at its initial stage that's why there are some complicated parts of it but I do suggest some features such as, messaging feature just like in Instagram; photo cropping and editing feature when posting a picture; circles would also be good; and lastly, ability to look at someone's profile picture. Overall, the app was nice and already makes some people an online friends within just few days of launch",1
To much Bug,0

"Everything else is OK , but When you go to gallery you have no option for going to your photo albums.

It's good but missing a lot of features,1
"Мені подобається, плавно, мя'ко, ненав'язливо",2
Nice Threads,0
This not a final review but I just wanna say why do you have to have a instagram account to login,0
It is a good app although I'd like it to have dark mode enabled because I like my settings in light mode and social media on dark mode,1
The experience was Meh at best. I guess I was expecting more with all the hype. I deleted the app when I saw how much data it's collecting from my phone. No thanks Meta.,0
Too much personal information is being collected.,0
"We need a likes tab on profiles that users can choose to make private or public but that they have access to and can see all their liked posts at.

The likes feature should be used to connect and keep track of information but right now that information is hidden to the users while fully visible to the engineers. 

I understand it needs to be different than other platforms but I think accessing “likes” on profiles is a universal feature and would not make threads more like any other platform, it would just make it more user friendly.

Thanks!",1
Nice app download now,2
Can't login,0
Just copy the Twitter concept with low UI and features quality as social media app.,0

Looking interesting,2
"I want to know one thing that Instagram still underdevelopment, cannot serve ads and start payment for users alike YouTube, and developing new app...

Nice. F elon,2

Very fantastic app,1
"Just waste of time, no creative updates could add a value!",0
Brilliant app! So pleased to finally have an alternative to the garbage fire that Twitter has become 😃,2
Needs translate integration ASAP. No reason in 2023 for it not to be there. Update: Keeps crashing. Bugs galore.,0
App doesn't work properly.... It's lagging heavily....,0

Twitter competition,1
Introduce poles for voting,1
Very very glittering and glitche interface. Too much bad experience.,0
Sign in from Google account should also be possible,0
Is beautiful,2
I’m all for an alternative to twitter but this ain’t it yet. The UI lacks the polish that Twitter has and is just kinda clunky and unfinished in general. But to be fair I understand since it like just came out and is still being developed. My biggest issue with the UI is that the front page timeline thing isn’t very personalized and I’m getting a ton of stuff from people I don’t follow. I am looking forward to seeing this improve and be better,0
"OK so far, but only want to see threads from people that I actually follow.",1
Good,2
I jumped on to see if it truly was like twitter. I hate twitter. And threads is just like it so I’ll never use it. But now I can’t delete my threads account without deleting my Instagram account. WTH?? AND… the badge on my IG profile won’t hide like I keep telling it to do. What a pain.  “You can’t add the badge back on one you delete it”… says the company that keeps adding it back on and all I want is for it to go away!!!! I am now infuriated.,0
Good,2
"The newsfeed so random, i follow my friend, my friend follow some people then its on my timeline/newsfeed, like huh not even in my interest even not im following them, worse social app i ever downloaded.",0

"It's amazing, fun and better. Tho how do u get back in when someone found a way to log u out",1
"Clunky app. Twitter runs 100x better and is just overall…better. Don’t waste your time, it’s Facebook trying to copy Twitter and doing a terrible job at it.",0
"It's a great start, however, needs some tweaking. We are all used to Twitter and what it does, so I understand this app can't do EXACTLY what it does, because it will simply be Twitter again 🤷🏽‍♀️. So hopefully this app will come with BETTER ideas for people to continue using.",1
"Twitter+ins=Threads，It's very best APP in 2023，and free to talk，also can follow my favourite youtuber in there！！！

As soon as I opened this app it went smoothly but right after 3 days it started crashing & the app doesn't open even at all,0

"Right now. This app sucks. No hashtags, no way of searching keywords. The only thing you can search is usernames. Your feed is loaded with a bunch of stuff you don't want to see.

"The application is really good but it still needs some amendments like; 1) Smoothness: the app is somewhat slow when scrolling to the top feeds. 2) Ability to save: as usual, not everyone would like to screenshot something that he/she is supposed to save. 3) Ability to change name and tag.

How is it difference Twitter?,1

Awesome,2
"As a starter this is okay but there are two deal breakers. One is the feed. You get stuff from accounts you don't follow and have no interest in and it cannot be changed. Second, if you log in with instagram, you can't change anything or deactivate profile on threads as it's synced. You have to change or just delete your entire instagram profile.",0
Love this application 😈,2
it's weird and confusing,1
"Everything is fine, but it would be better if the account could be opened separately.",1
I think I am the first person to leave a rating here even before starting the app,1
Runs well and is easier to use than twitter while not as much content as older social media (this is to be expected for a young app) it is easy to use and set up shows great promise,2
"I see way too many posts by accounts I don't follow. Twitter allowed me to only see the accounts I follow in my timeline. Stop with the suggested posts please, this isn't Instagram. And no snoozing of suggested posts. When I turn something off, I want it to stay off.",1

I feel like this could easily replace Twitter 😌Sorry Elon Musk 🥲,2
"Okay, pretty good start but there are a few deal breakers. #1 Carries your Instagram account, Anonymity is lost if you want to use the login for both #2 There isn't a page where I could only see posts from the people I follow, only the home page exists which is good at recommending new stuff but I can't find ANYTHING back after I scroll pass it once #3 Can't save photos. Why. Apart from theese, app works perfectly. Had no issues setting up, running, using",1
Elon vs Zuckerberg social war,2
"My Twitter is very much separate from both Facebook and IG. I don’t want IG follows/follower’s automatically on my Threads follows. In addition, I don’t want all these random people on my Feed. My Feed should just be people I am following. As of this Threads version, I much prefer Twitter and/or Mastodon. Even Spoutible is better.",0
"Slim downed Twitter, but better! The community has embraced positivity over negativity for the most part and the overall app experience has been great. As a new app, very feature light but easily usable for text-centric conversation and news",2

"Threads can be done better. 

Hoping the team can make some improvements from user feedbacks here. 

Missing:
-Number of views of your post (Like in Twitter)
-Bookmark or Save posts to your lists where you can reorders your saved posts to your preference
-Reduce spam posts or I will have to keep muting half the time and it is discouraging. 
-Top post sections could be fun based on your location just like the early days of Insta",2

Looks good,2
"I like it right now, it's fun and I love seeing the reactions. I also like how they're numbers on your Instagram account telling you what number you are when you joined the account. Overall a 10/10 thought obviously as time passes my opinion will change. EDIT: i still like this and people need to give it a chance, as it has been only 2 days since the app came out.",2
What about privacy? The app is collecting all the private datas such as photos videos location phone numbers email msgs every thing this app has serious privacy issues i would never recommend anyone to use this app,0
It's a second twitter Please God help me,0

"Title says it all but I’ll add that not everyone wants to cross pollinate with X Corp if they’re more Meta & vice versa so no bias but I’m all for new versions of apps of the same style, we seen it happen before with MySpace to
Facebook to Instagram etc etc so the future is more going to be about what flavor and company you prefer not necessarily what’s “better “ I’m here for Threads all day to succeed bc I prefer instagram predominantly and my prayers have been answered for them to roll out this style of app/ social media platform, I love it, can’t wait to see how it improves.",1

"Por ahora es aburrida pero he decidido darle una oportunidad. En lo personal nunca me ha gustado la app de Twitter, no me gusta su diseño, se me hace muy pesado y aburrido. Threads no es muy diferente a twitter en cuanto a funciones e interacción. Aún hay que pulir ciertos detalles .",2
So far the app is good. Expects to add more features in coming days.,2
Not worth switching from other social media. File upload is a fail and the setup is a disaster. I will change my review if you make this app usable.,0
Excellent app,2
Great day for me I love the app and it was nice to be here thank you sir,0
"In my opinion, this is the better app from Twitter. It gives us a better user experience and reliability. It is more similar like a Twitter.",2
"I hope there will be an update and improvement, such as creating a dark theme. I really hoping for this dark theme, even it's not important lol. However, so far I really love this app compared to Twitter. Thanks Meta.",1
Very bad app not working properly getting hang,0
"It's good but it's like Facebook & Instragram & what'app, twitter competition means that the thread needs to be changed a little more, pay is not working properly, the sound needs to be pressed on each reel, the keyboard is more important than the thread.",0
it's glitching a lot everything is overlaped to eachother,0
Why in the world is it linked with Instagram? Nobody wants all their Instagram followers to find them on a different app.,0
Wow the Instragram amazing Twitter ki tarah,2
Interesting,0
Very bad,0
Excelente 👌,2
Nice 👍,2
Ok,2
Thanks for threads an Instagram,2
Good start but could be fleshed out a little more. I really hope they make it easy for you to switch between accounts like Instagram does so you don’t have to log out and log in every time. It’s also easy to switch apps from threads to Instagram but not visa-versa. Threads has an Instagram logo top right to switch easily but to switch from Instagram to threads there is no such shortcut. I would also like to possibly see a your all caught up divider so you don’t mindlessly scroll the threads you seen before.,2
Looks like only instagram uses can log in. Will there be an update to allow users to sign up for just threads ? I don’t use any apps except twitter & I don’t want to create an instagram account just for threads. Would be great if they’re decoupled,0

And also I am not able to see other people threads, getting message something went wrong. I re installed app and now it's working.",1
It’s a cool app. I believe it’s affecting my Timeline on IG though. All the photos & vids are showing up Grey on my IG Timeline.,1
Users shouldn’t be required to have an insta account. I understand that the Zuck wants us to live in his metaverse but some of us want an apartment right outside of it. Please make Threads that outside apartment.,1
"I hope that it will have a dark mode feature, and also to have messages, so atleast we can send photo, video or vm there. I also hope that there could be a feature where you can also put video and photo stories. Lastly, it is too hard to switch account, so I hope you can do something with it. Thank you.",1
I didn't use this app but I will use in the future that's why I'm giving you 1 rate,0

Unable to upload pictures. The app keeps crashing.,0
"I haven't run into many issues, mostly because I'm not much of a poster so I'm not adding photos and everything else, BUT the past couple of days my feed is full of accounts I don't follow. Sometimes it's because someone I follow commented or rethreaded it, but that's not usually the case anymore. I use the app to keep up with and engage with the people I actually follow, not everyone else",0

Amazing 👏,2
"Downloaded yesterday and I’m enjoying it for what it is so far; sign-up was super easy since you can import all your data from Instagram, and I love how you can directly access other accounts’ Insta pages to follow them there too.

My only issue is that the app feels a little bare-bones as of now. I understand it’s brand new and will be in the process of developing itself over time, but I’d love to see a bit more in terms of interface. The app feels a bit empty without a proper tagging system and it’s extremely hard for me to find new content and users to follow because my feed is mostly people I already follow on Instagram (plus random verified accounts and one or two new creators I find interest in). Please consider implementing a hashtag or keyword function for the Search bar (or maybe even an Explore page), and I’d probably find a lot more interest in the app!

Overall, this is a pretty decent start and I’m interested to see where it goes next… and to have a place to post my 3 AM intrusive thoughts.",1

Hard to find the people you follow as it just gives you hundreds of random posts.,0
Their is an only one option for login that is Instagram but their is many Facebook user can also try this app and i think that most of facebook user are older there is and some probability they don't have an insta ac if we provide the login with Facebook then uts help..

I would give 5 star to this app but i am not giving because when I scroll the home feed all the text start shivering it is not working properly in my phone please do something meta thanks.,0
Amazing!!,2
"Everything seemed fine, some little glitches when needing to verify my account but the problem started when I went back onto Instagram and couldn't access my homepage as it was replaced with a while screen saying ""Welcome to Instagram. Follow some accounts"" while giving me suggested accounts, treating me like a new account. I've deleted both apps multiple times and restated my phone, worked for a little but now back to how I mentioned. A real pain, I've sent complaints but nothing yet.",0
"Threads in its current iteration is a random collection of unsorted and unsortable conversations among people I don't know and mostly don't care to know. Why do I follow people or have followers? I cannot actually follow anyone unless I navigate (tediously) to their profile page and scroll down at threads they created or re-threaded. That is just too cumbersome to provide an enjoyable experience. For example, I welcomed a dozen or so folks that cover my favorite college teams. But, now that Threads has scale, I rarely ever see their posts, excuse me, threads. Oh, I can still find their comments - - - over on Twitter in my Sports List. Threads is like I am at a cocktail party, incognito, overhearing conversations and feeling like I just want to leave.",0

I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.,0

Its is too amazing app by meta to promote conversation its a very good app just go for it..,2
So nic app,2
few features we'd love to have: - ability to save media - translation - ability to bookmark / save threads & compartmentalise them - ability to manage following - repost numbers - thread views,1
This is another tool to steal user's data,1
This Is App is fantastic Because This App Was Look Like Twitter I Love This App,2
It works well though in the followers part you can't notice who is a mutual follower and who's not until you open up the profile.,1

It requires you use you Instagram account log in. What if you don’t want to? What if you want to keep it separate? What if you want to use your Facebook name? You have no choice. Why? Does Meta think they are the MCU? Why does everything have to be connected and why can’t we choose how we want to be connected if you don’t give us a choice?,1

"This app doesn't have a lot of basic features. Plus a huge flow in UI. See when typing a reply to a thread, the text box goes behind the keyboard. Just add hashtags.",1
Zuck making a new app so I don’t get any girl here too. Sobs!🙂,1
Excellent,2
"It's literally just your instagram account crossed over to a subpar, basic app of censored content of people whining. Can't change your user name or anything and if you delete your new Threads account, you delete your Instagram account with it. Terrible features, bad vibes, limited features, has no grand or promising feel. Disappointment. You will be hard-pressed to find anything interesting on this app for years, not worth waiting around for. You will see selfies and nothing insightful.",0
This is okay,1
"Awful App - I was inundated with posts from people I wasn't following, and there's no way to stop it, so I couldn't find posts from people I was following, so deleted it.",0
Nice app. I love it❤️👌👌👍,2
Not compare to Twitter because Twitter in office news in this app and in thread to users use to meme and Fun so this app is flop Not to satisfied to people.👎,0
It’s really fun I really like it and am the first person to review it,1

Good apps and easy use,2
So far so good I would like to put this out there please please make sure that this platform stays Scam free we don't need or want it. And please keep it free from hate only advertisement s from real business not scams,2
"I wanted to like it. I’m a social media manager and I posted from Threads directly to IG.. you know, the other app y’all own, and guess what happened? All my other posts stopped showing on my grid. For 2 days I tried everything to figure out why my posts weren’t showing up on my grid…. Finally I deleted the odd man- the Threads cross over post and BAM, my posts popped back up. You’re welcome for that FREE information. Now if y’all could hire me since apparently y’all have a  billion dollars and can’t even figure out how to make your own app work with cross posting. 

Giant waste of money and time!",0
So far so good,2
𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐞,2
Stay away as it tracks 100% everything about you! How is it even pass the privacy act to be available on app store? This makes me wonder what has been happening with my insta and fb??! Consider delete them all. Tiktok is bad but this is the worst of all.,0
Need multi account same as Instagram ! I am having one personal and one business accounts in Instagram where i can switch between but in Threads there is no switch option !,1

Okay,2
Good,2
The app keeps crashing when I enter a thread,1
Threads iam ur new joiner 👍good,2
"I'm currently using my Lenovo Tab 4 8 to join Threads. At first, the UI seems it's not optimised for my tablet, it's just glitched out and can't read any threads, making it unusable. I think the UI is only optimised for phones, and not tablets. I guess I'll be using the web version of Threads (if it's available) until you fix the UI. Also, Threads functions like that one bird app where everyone is literally angry about, and yes, Threads is like an alternative to that app!",0
"Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.",1
So far so good,1

Try again later.” Very frustrating, I have people that can view and post on their account just fine without any issue.",0

Great app 😍,2
ALLAH is Greatest,2
"Good interface but function not as good as twitter. I have a few suggestions: 1. Dark mode option. 2. Can change username even if linked to Instagram. 3. ""Back"" button should close the app directly. Why scroll back all the way to the top before closing? I wouldn't be able to continue where I left off, it's inconvenient. 4. What's the point of ""following"" if my timeline is full of people I don't follow? A few suggestions here and there is cool, but it's too much now it isn't fun anymore.",1

"The UI is constrained, thoughtful and masterfully engineered — a world-class product. Only upstaged by a relentless stream of the trashiest influencers who have ever roamed this scorched earth. There’s no escaping the Kardashian wannabes breaking news regurgitaters, as they fill my feed with garbage I never asked for. Why oh why would you treat such a well designed app with such disrespect? Oh, I know. Because the name of the game is maximum attention. It’s only a matter of time before the ads are interleaved between the celebrity trash talk. Then the only step left is to optimize the algorithm to maximize fear and anxiety to increase stickiness. Oh Meta, it’s so so clear where you’re taking us and it’s so disappointing.",1
You basically only see posts from big mainstream media you don’t even follow. I only ever saw a post from someone I actually followed maybe twice. Waste of time if you can’t find anything unique.,0
Very good app for using,2

"It's refreshing to be somewhere not [insert rival app here], but the app needs work: 1) Chrono order timeline (seeing the same non-followed accounts is boring). 2) In addition, if you want to stick w/ the current timeline (For You), fine, but give us a Following timeline as well. 3) For brands/social media managers that work on multiple accounts, please implement an easier way to switch accounts than having to log out then log in (it gets annoying). 4) Please add a way to schedule posts.

Give us sync for Reddit comments and features mixed with Youtube, mixed with Instagram, and leave us alone. It also collects your data more than usual. Mark should pay us to use it instead",0

"i downloaded threads to see what the hype was about. after scrolling through the feed for a few minutes, i decided i didn’t like it. the format of the app wasn’t very aesthetically pleasing. so, i tried to deactivate my account since i didn’t want it anymore. i clicked deactivate, several times, and it never would deactivate. so, i just decided to delete the app and forget about it. except… all of my notifications started coming through my instagram app?? AND my threads number was still in my profile. i clicked “hide” multiple times, but every single time i refresh my profile, it pops up again. the number on my profile is actually ugly and killing the aesthetics of my profile. it’s so big and in your face. no one cares what your thread number is. please let me delete my account.",0

Not a serious Twitter competitor. Feed is littered with content that I don't follow and is not in chronological order. It's the worst of Facebook trying to imitate Twitter without actually incorporating the best part about Twitter,0

"it always says ""something went wrong""",0
"I'll give it 4 star because this aap is good, I can easily transfer my Instagram account to Threads account, it is Twitter but.. I like it 👍",1
"This app has potential to kill what was once an amazing app and community, with Twitter, but it’s desperate for some key features. I want so badly for this app to succeed. Specifically needing:

1) a cleaned up and chronological timeline. Absolutely, under no circumstances, should we be seeing stuff from 1-2 days ago as the top threads that show up. Period. 
2) ability to see solely stuff from people that you follow
3) hashtags….
4) ability to search and subscribe to hashtags and key phrases 
5) the notifications for posts from accounts are delayed anywhere between 12-24 hours. That’s literally useless, if I subscribe to someone that means I want to see it the second they post it",0

I don’t know what I did differently, it seems like I’m the only one w this issue and it’s extremely frustrating.",0

Has nothing to offer that Twitter doesn't other than very strict guidelines on what you can say. The only reason this app even exists is to data harvest.,0
"Worse than twitter in nearly every respect. When the hype dies down, everyone will be back on twitter in a week. Also keeps crashing every time when I click replies now. You have to create an Instagram account to sign up as well. Edit: also keeps crashing when I try and make a thread. At least it has quite a smooth interface (carbon copy of twitter though).",0

"I dislike that sharing a post is called ""repost"". As an artist, reposting a post usually consists of someone saving art and posting it to their own account. Sharing or ""retweeting"" is welcome, but reposting is a no-no. Why would this app call sharing ""reposting""?? It's unclear who gets the ""like"" when a post is shared. It should be the op. That is one thing IG does not get right (and Twitter does). I hope Meta gets it right. Option to delete threads account without deleting IG.",1
"It's an so better way uing Instagram , I suggest everyone to download it as soon as you see my review!",2
The app is exciting and new. The process to transfer over from instagram into threads is seamless and easy. Would love to have a tab that lets you see posts from only people you’re following. My thread is full of posts from people I don’t follow and have no interest in following. Very excited to see what updates this app brings in the future.,1

The app is well deigned and it really gives an instagram experience with a dash of twitter but it a more positive connection and a easy log in selection that twitters long log in process.,2

"I thought this app was ok and I'd like to see how it can be improved in the future. As of now what I really want is a curated feed or a following feed, I don't see why we can follow people if we won't see their posts if we're not online 24/7. I saw a lot of marketing for this as an app for artists but it hard to support people when you can't see what they post. With some improvements in accessibility and content I could see it being a good app that I'd use.",1

"Never thought I could loathe anyone more than Mark Zuckerberg until Elon Musk came along. But like new Twitter, which seems to think you are lonely and unhappy and need to be fed a river of moronic propaganda and drivel, this app comes preloaded with thousands of unfunny, uninteresting meme accounts you will spend several minutes blocking every time you open it before you can see the content you have actually selected  for yourself. Just what you needed in life, I'm sure. But at least it's not Twitter. Fingers crossed it gets better.",0

I think it should automatically recognize your Instagram password and username. Most of us can't remember that. Have been trying to login for more than two days now,0

"Ok so, i have been using threads for about 2 hours. I have found some good, but also some bad. I love how easy it is to use the app, I love the simplicity, and how easy it was to sign in, just directly using your Instagram account. However, if you’re like me, and you want to use a separate account for Threads, then you won’t love the first implementation of the app. You are stuck using your name and profile picture that you used for Instagram and the app seems to crash quite often and I would also love some features like DMs and a couple other things. I am super excited to use this app and see how it compares to Twitter!",1
"Yall experiencing pages and posts overlapping each other... Go to profile, theres button at the top right corner then report a problem.. just go there then go back to homepage and the bug's gone☺️",2
Best but need to edit option when photos uploaded with captions,2
"Great start but needs immediate improvements if you want to bring in and retain customers outside of Instagram who prefer to socialize by text then photos, to include: 
 - Feed to capture posts of only those you follow, with option to have separate recommendations feed (which I don’t want)
- Automatic translation for all posts or button/link to translate any post (because most of my interests are overseas like Japan) 
- Ability to create lists of accounts you don’t follow but are interested in their occasional posts (for example: news, health, lifestyle, etc) 
- Edit button 
- Trends feeds
- Ability to switch locations (because of interests, and therefore see different trends in different countries)

I like the app. But I think it would better to implement hashtags to find relevant posts for folks to find like minded folks .,1

Steal all your personal data as usual from meta nothing new,0
I am using a device on Android 9 and the app is not functioning properly it glitches and the surfaces overlaps with eachother like its hacked or smn. Please look into it (update : it only happens in dark mode),0
"When I first installed it, it was fine, did what it’s supposed to. After a couple days, I couldn’t view any replies to posts, any posts of a (public) user, it was basically worthless. Keep getting “Something went wrong, try again” error or “Content not available”. Tried all solutions but none worked, so I had to delete the app. Hopefully a future release will fix this problem because I really want to use it.

I also was bothered that upon installation, many of my Instagram followers “requested” a follow (which is an automatic thing upon install?). It would be nice to differentiate who actually clicked a follow button, and who did the automatic follow request.",0

Why r people mad that this app is bad. Like bro chill this is a meme app made my mark 🤣🤣,2
A Twitter clone that is in internal closed alpha stage. The app sucks big time. Lacks on features and polish. Recommender algorithm straight up sucks. It almost feels like non existent. I guess it wasnt something meta invested in wholeheartedly. Also the biggest bummer is the Instagram mindset of the users. People can't be forced to morph into the forum like UX it provides. Absolutely no reason to switch from Twitter or Mastodon. Also no data transparency.,0
Worst app please don't download Instagram users you'll loose your Instagram account and can't use it properly,0
Nice UI,2

Cheap copy,0
"I'm open app it's shake, i can't roll up and down",0
"I like where this is going but a lot of things need to change before I use this consistently. Please make a section that consists only of the posts by the people I’m following! I’m tired of seeing random people on my feed, so I don’t use this app very much for that reason. Secondly, please add drafts. That one just seems like a no brainer to me. Thirdly, a trending page/trending hashtags would be great. Since you’re clearly taking a page out of Twitter’s playbook, why not add the good parts of Twitter? 

Also, this is just a thought, but I would really love a section similar to Facebook Groups on Twitter. Spaces where fandoms can interact just within their enclosed group. 

Thank you! Hoping to see this app improve in the future!",1
"Hey meta I'm I will give this app to 5 stars but in this app so many features are missing like trending feed , following people's posts,#,DM and many more please improve the app and user experience",2

I would give 5 if thread could offer the real-time hot search & hashtags..may be it would like a blue bird 555 don't worry you have the other options..I swear~,1
Not a bad app it needs an update becoz whenever I upload video there is audio problem...automatically becomes muted ...u can also can't see live videos on threads ..only notification of live video is coming... Most important is there is login glitch... whenever I switched my accounts on instagram app ..the threads app also log out my account on threads app.. Every time I have to login my accounts on both apps..plz fix these glitches ..thanku,0

"It's great, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Publish"" button at the top of the post menu. Also, there is a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but it needs some polishing. Also, I wish there was an option to create an account from scratch instead of importing an Instagram account.",1
"When they first revealed the app, we thought it had potential. But it took only 5 minutes to see that.... NO. It's really just Instagram for tweet-like texts, and, like Instagram, it shows random people all the time. It really doesn't try to do what Twitter does, it's just Instagram",0
"Cool. A Twitter replacement. I was an early adopter on Twitter but also left early on because it just wasn’t my jam. 

The problem with this: 
• the home feed is all just celebrities, influencers, and others I don’t really care about. Let me have a clear and clean home and let me decide who I want to add to the feed.

• the culture already feels wonky. Maybe it will change later, but I started to see the ugliness already come out in people. I’m sooooo over toxic spaces and I just don’t want to be in a place where anyone with an issue can project their anger at me and others.

• way too much data permissions. They basically ask permission for everything except your DNA. Also, if you want to remove that thread symbol from your IG, you’re told “if you do this you’ll NEVER get it back?” It feels so dramatic and hostile. 

I’ll revisit it in late 2023 but, for now, it’s not a comfortable place to be online.",0

Lol doesnt even work. If your insta is linked you cant unfollow people on thread or you unfollow them on Instagram its kind dumb. Post wont send fail message everytime. So far not impressed.,0
Better than Twitter for sure,2
It would be good if it has people i follow and people who i follow in separate. But so far so good. 🤍,2

Could’ve just migrated Instagram to meta bringing everything in-house but you’ve created 3 companies that do the same crap. Nothing new. Now your losing traffic from Instagram or Meta when people use threads or vice versa. Overkill,0

App only pushes blue check mark content cause they want you to pay for it. They have banned accounts with no reasoning behind it. Another fake version of what social media claims to be.,0

We still need to build this platform. Second I can’t deactivate my account. Now I can’t remove the threads badge from my Instagram profile. When I remove the badge it says “once you remove you can’t add again” I hit remove and refresh and it’s added again. Making people use or promote your platform, when they’ve decided they don’t want to use it, against their will, is not a good idea.",0

Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.,0
Good app but addictive like insta whereas Twitter is like informative and useful this will waste my time,2
"So, I'm wondering ... Is Mark willing to upgrade the trending algorithms? Because this is really a concerning issue. This app is supposed to get data directly from Instagram, and yet a lot of posts in my feed are BS and random! Another thing, since he wants to challenge Twitter, where the heck are the hashtags?",1

How to delete permanently without deleting Instagram account ...!,0
Well at first for me truthfully I don't like it one bit I downloaded it coz everyone around me downloaded it and I fell out of place so o dowoaded it and at first my expirence were horrible I thought we had another app like twitter and blue bird became trash so here is another but when I start using thread I am addicted coz no ads and extra money verification easy to use and your making a account is like cuttuing butter so I definitely like it and we need it,1
My insta keeps crashing ever since i joined threads,0
"I use my iPad for social media and it is irritating that the Threads screen is like I’m using a iPhone Only for how little of my screen it takes up. You need to allow full screen and in landscape or portrait mode. I feel like I’m not able to see everything. 
Otherwise so far so good - but please address this issue quickly. It’s bothersome enough that I jump off the app much sooner than any other social media app I’ve ever used.",1

"The app is mostly fine (just Instagram's version of Twitter basically), but my main issue is how there's no way to turn off suggested posts so all the people I follow just get drowned in a bunch of threads from people I don't care about. The only way I've figured out how to get rid of them is by muting individual accounts, but that's way too much effort.",1
Just hangs when trying to install,0
"This app is honestly pretty great so far but it’s just missing some key features! (Following tab, Dms, viewing your likes, a trending or explore page, hashtags etc. It really feels like a peaceful and fun app to use please don’t change the feel of it, otherwise people are gonna drop off and not come back.",1
Alright....,1
Twitter better,0
"I expect the posts on my feed to be from only the pages that I follow but what I get in addition to those posts is posts from pages that I don't even follow at all & have zero interest in following on Threads.  So Meta/Instagram/Facebook could fix that please.

The other thing is since I have two different Instagram & Thread accounts (one is my personal & the other is my artsy one that I use for arts & crafts, beauty, quotes, entertainment, & other fun, innocent stuff), I need a way similar to Twitter's way of switching accounts that makes it easier to switch accounts.

Other changes need to be made as well but these two are the ones I want the most.  I am not asking for perfection & the most perfect app since perfection is an overrated illusion, but I also understand that this is a new app & so there might be things to improve so I'm sure constructive feedback from users would be appreciated.",1
Excellent,2
good,2
"Was a great app for the first year, seems to have a lot of bugs but I believe it has potential. and am the first to review it🤞🏼",1
At least you can delete the account. the shortcut is really annoying. I've deleted it but still can't delete it.,0
I also installed this app to see how it performs but it is performing very well,2

The amount of data this app collects from you is absurd and you can’t delete your Threads profile without also deleting Instagram. This is nothing but a trap set up by Zuckerberg to siphon as much user data as possible,0
It's on star for threads because their badge appears on my peofile,0
"It's full of people I don't care about, I don't follow them yet still appear in my feed. Very few options in the so-called fediverse app.",0
Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.,0
"Meh. Not the greatest experience on a Chromebook. Seems to be customized for phones only. Opens in a little screen that you can't expand or resize - for reasons that are a complete mystery to me. Judging from the fact that every other app I know of is resizeable, this seems like it was a conscious choice by the developers . Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.",0
Simply a copy of Twitter.,0
Dont automatically add instagtam followers please. Also If one worked for twitter it doesn't mean Elon owns you forever. Nice to see people have a choice.,2

"I’ve been hoping for something to replace Twitter and Facebook for awhile now (since Twitter was ruined and Facebook has been less and less personal for years) — so naturally Threads intrigued me. So far I’m cautiously optimistic, but it does bother me that it’s owned by Facebook/Instagram and the app is very minimal at the start. So we’ll see how it goes.

My wife and I both downloaded Threads within 24 hours of each other. I’ve had a positive experience with it so far, but for some reason her account showed her some very questionable stuff (three posts in around thirty seconds of scrolling). I’m guessing this is because I follow more accounts so I don’t see posts from unfollowed accounts, but it could also be due to Instagram privacy/security settings since many of those sync over.

My main concern at this point is with content visibility control. When someone I follow replies to someone I don’t, I should see a button to show the original post and not the full post by default. There should not be random posts on the feed, especially when they highlight risqué photos. Some people may like seeing unrelated posts, but there needs to be a simple control for seeing this or not. As it stands, my wife has deactivated her account already (less than ten minutes of use) and I may be following suit rather shortly. I understand it’s very new still, but this is important and needs to be addressed promptly for the sake of users and the platform.",0
There is a difficulty to download the app however the network is OK in my region.,0
Very 👍,2
"The new app is totally different and so awesome! But something is going on with the app now, I can't refresh my account or comment nor post why ? Hope my account isn't having any issues yet ? Or is it from threads app ?",1

Zuck is a cuck,0
I never like threading until it got launched lol. Can I be viral though?,2

Basically this is just another social media spy like Facebook and instagram only now making it easier to silence people and censor content people don’t like.   If you enjoyed it on Facebook and you enjoyed it on twitter pre-Elon you’re going to love this!   It’s quite literally a twitter rip off that links instagram… so yeah remember “meta” is still Facebook the same company who sold off all your personal information pictures and other information without consent yeah that same Facebook.

I hope there will be a translate button for those posts that are not in English. ☺️,2

I'm happy with this app. I want to unhide badge of threads on instagram also there is not other option for bring it back so i request you work for it asap. I appreciate your work. Please understand my concern.,1

Isn't working properly. Too much lag and not working properly.,0

The UI and UX is awesome. They should add trends.,1
Yeah it's a cool application.... Thanks meta for introducing threads,2
I do love threads its bringing a twitter style form social media to a more mainstream audience. However the biggest problem I have with threads is the lack if a for you/exlpore page and the fact that I dont have an option to see post only from people I follow.,1
"There is nothing original about this app. It’s literally a copy and paste of twitter with 80% less features. Meta states that there’s over 100k signups but the reality is that it’s more like 100k instagram imports. Regardless, app needs to add new stuff quick or it will die.",0
i rock with the idea instagram is putting out but i can’t use multiple accs without being logged off if instagram i hope this update fixed it,1
"This app is boring, what's the point of having this? You have 1000s of followers and get 5 likes. What a waste of time this app is. Worst part is all you see are verified people complaining about irrelevant things in their perfect lives.",0

"After 7-8 hours, I gave up. It's a lonely place if you're arriving blind without existing Instagram followers. A default feed full of influencers I can't relate to and if it's possible to search for posted content that interests me, I can't figure it out. I'll check back in a few months when it's more mature. Uninstalling for now.",0

"This app is trying to track even MORE of my data than ever before? And the only way to make it stop is to completely delete you Instagram??? You won’t tell us WHY you need this extra data or continuous tracking EVEN AFTER the app is deleted (seems like a violation of Apples developer terms imo), nor are you making it easy for people to opt out of the app and it’s services. And the fact that the UK won’t allow this up in the App Store in their region for these very reasons are more than reason enough to not download.  If I’m completely misinformed or wrong, please do tell, otherwise you guys need to seriously change what this app does exactly",0

"I really like this app, but I have one suggestion to make it a little better. Maybe if you can add translations to a persons preferred language like there is on Instagram. I think this will make the app a lot better for its users. Otherwise it’s a very good app.",1
Still learning and navigating but seriously I don't care nor want to discover random people's posts that I am not following on my page. If I wanted to I would search them up to get their posts specifically. Also can't find the posts from accounts that I do follow. Please fix this as this is one of Twitters only redeeming qualities that they have over you.,1
Superb appp,2

As is it's impossible to use. I do not have an Instagram account. I cannot use the app without creating an Instagram account. You cannot create an Instagram account from within the app. Ergo the app is impossible to use without already having an Instagram account or going to Instagram to create an account outside of the app. 0/10,0

"Overall it's a good idea, but I hate that it only has a for you page (so you have to see everyone's posts, not just those you follow), and that your account cannot be deleted unless you delete your Instagram account, too. And once you link your ig account, you can't change your name, username, picture, or bio unless you change it on instagram. It'd be a much more enjoyable app if the two weren't so tightly connected and if you weren't forced to see posts from people you don't like or care about",0

"Whatever anyone says this app is the best thing to come out right now ever since musk took over twitter. Threads is basically like a big group chat and we’re all like a family
on there. Nobodies being weird or saying out of pocket things everyone is actually nice to each other, unlike the other app. Zuck you really stepped up and made one of the best apps out there. And everyone is already addicted, keep it up!",2
Trash app.,0
Nice App....!!,0
Not bad,2
Yo cool,1
Needed to log back into threads but forgot my main password. Password recovery isn’t working saying “invalid parameters”.,1
Good experience for meta verses,2

Really good app I'm in love with it 🤍,2

Bekar app hai Instagram par to ladkiyan msg ka reply nahi karti thi lekin yha to msg hi nahi kar sakte 🥲,0
a fantastic app,2
This app was not good work because it is scam from Twitter? 3/10,0
"App with Limited Login Options I recently tried out an app that caught my interest due to its promising features and positive reviews. However, my experience quickly turned sour when I realized that the app did not allow login with a Google ID. This limitation significantly hindered my ability to conveniently access the app and affected my overall user experience. One of the main advantages of using Google login is the convenience it offers. With just a few taps, I can seamlessly access.",0
Already better than what Elon has out 🤦‍♀️,2
Nice pretty good,2
So far this app is good but my feed gets full of people I don't follow,1
Not much useful,0
First person to review?,2
"The app screen glitches every time I scroll, like it glitches so hard that the text becomes unreadable. Does anyone else experience this too? Or is it just me?",0
"i think its a good app, does need work like any other app obviously but we should be able to delete our accounts without having to delete our instagrams if we have it linked it, especially to those who didnt know that rule or didnt read about it (like me)",1
OMG this for best feature of insta.💖,2
"I love this app, way fewer spam bots than most, great community. Needs a few more features and that's it.",2
Great,2
There should also be a section that shows top trends.,1
This is Instagram with a new logo and in black. That's all it is. Stoopid.,0
Good,0
"We need; 1) Easier method to switch between accounts, just like Instagram. 2) A way to filter the threads we see. We should have the option to only see Threads from the people we follow.",1
Nice,1
Too early to say but I like the interface. A bit slow though. Will share more in coming days. Follow @baloch_travelogue,1
I really love it,2
Number one,2
This is not a good application like Twitter this is a cheap copy of Twitter,0

Bad and poor,0
"I don't like that I can't edit an image before I post it. Also, when I want to post a picture, all of my gallery just spills out, no folders. It's stressful. Asides these, it's a great app Ps. Can we get dark mood🙂",0
Very beautiful UI. But please make Likes & Quotes of a thread more prominent under it. & Yes we absolutely need a thread DM. Plus it crashes sometimes while posting threads. I hope it will be better soon. An amazing Application tho. Love it. 🫶🏻,1
"Bruh the new social app rip , same as twitter but with better UI but the biggest flex of twitter is open speech as u can give ur opinion on anything and their ceo is also cool , this app also collects lot of data and also there was nothing new just twitter users posting same content here also so it's a big fail.",0

This app is great,2
Instagram account doesn't work after downloading threads. What is a solution to this?🙁,0

Having to create an instagram account to use this is a stupid requirement.,0
I think it's a good app,1
"So far I love it..clean interface, 5 minute videos, 500 character limit, import your Instagram details with a few clicks, follow your Instagram followers with one click, the ability to post to mastadom coming..I think Twitter is dead and zuckerberg and Meta have a winner 🏆",2
Very good app. More tools waiting,1

What if people dont want others know their instagram account? Why do i have a direct link to my instagram account in my profile? Whay can't i disable or remove it? Where is privacy?,0
Need to improve.Same as Twitter,0
Will have to check in on it again in a few weeks.  It crashed while trying to search for someone.,0
Lovely,2
Show me the updates from the people that I FOLLOW. Why pushing random accounts to the feed? I haven't come across a single friend's account in the last two days.,0
"Why you guys don't fix it's bugs when I first time downloaded it,it's login went good and then when I scroll it things are getting overlaped, I was not able to see a word , I deleted it and downloaded it again but the same problem occurs all the time , fix it as soon as possible",0

"So easy to sign up if you are already on Insta. Like the interface, but they need to make some changes so that people can differentiate the posts easily. Rn It takes some effort to be able to tell apart which post belongs to whom",1
This app is very much interesting entertaining and it will help you learned many good things about the world and universe I don't like it but I really love it and thank you so much for bringing this app,2
It'll help to connect more people,2

Bad,0
Than any other social media app out there,1
When I open the app. The login procedure goes good but suddenly bug appears in the screen and I can't operate the app properly. Face very difficulties to log out and also uninstalling the app is not working,0
The most restrictive use app that i have ever seen in my life.,0
Cópia do Twitter,0
"Well, So far, I like it.. Still figureing it out..;)",1
"Do NOT install! The app is following accounts automatically on behalf of my account or sending follow request without me knowing. I don't even open the up, just receiving the notifications. Isn't that illegal Zuck??",0
"So many bugs while writing keep showing my keyboards not keys, Fix that issue",1
Why there's a lot of accounts showing in my feed even if I don't follow them????!!!,0
Twitter is much better than This 😡😡😡,0
"Its cool but here are some issues i see. First off you have no hashtags, you cant search topics, no dm feature, you cant add a backdrop picture. First week you could share a link and the thumbnail would show. Today it only show the link in preview and then minimizes to just the link when posted....something people are less likely to click on. Some people are not dealing with that issue. Cant claim you have an app that will allow more EXSPOSURE and things like that are missing or glitching out.",0
Prefect,2
Very worst application 😔,0
"This app is always glitching, should must support low-end devices as it's like on Instagram",0
"Verry good app , but lounch new features like trading section",2
The most millionaire in the world is crying bc the thousens of people he fire got a new job? Lmao f Twitter,2

"i have downloaded this app only for my former prime minister (IMRAN KHAN) And INSHAALLAH, Imran Khan will be the next prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, INSHAALLAH",2
Better than Twitter 😂 ♥️♥️♥️,1
"The app as a platform is great, besides the interface and stuff... but one only issue is that scrolling is low smooth plus I would like to suggest some ways to make Threads go incredibly stylish, such as the like button animation and the app's icon color matching for android 13+ However it's an excellent app that's looking to be perfect, thank you Marks crew 👌",1
So when you people are going to launch your AI?,2

One of the best app so far,2
Good,2
"I installed this only bc I hate the new Elon Musk contolled Twitter SO much. I'm quite confident that many others feel the same way. I hope it's good, but at least it can't be any worse than the new Twitter. It must be hard to be both a genius and a dope at the same time!",2
"threads is horrible 😭 I can't see anything, all the letters r mixing up I can't see a single world. Whenever I open this app it acts weirdly, like so crazyyy!! So messy",0
"It makes no sense, what's point of this app? I have seen hundreds of better apps than this one",0
Would have rate it a 5 if the reels options in Instagram were available and some of the Instagram features,1
عادى,0
Glitch 😔,0
♡♡♡,2
"I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete seperate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.",1
Nice 👍,1
Best,1
I downloaded this app because I wanted to see what my friends whom I follow are posting. So far my feed is flooded with the threads of random people I never followed. If this is the case why would I ever follow anyone knowing their threads will never show up in my feed anyway??? Please fix and this will be a solid application.,1
"It doesn't open, it just keeps on loading",0
"Zuck is a left wing loon. Threads is a ""safe space"" for all the losers who can't tolerate an opposing opinion on Twitter. GOOD!",0

I love the interface but my issue with this app is that almost all of the content I see in my timeline are from accounts I don't follow. I would really love it if the next update would give you an option to have your followings as the only posts you see in your timeline.,1
Great app,2
Worst app,0
No limit on posts you can look at and less incel Andrew Tate stans,2
I like the app very well The creator tried,1
Ik,2
Cool👍,2
It should have a translate option for comments and replies.,1
This app just benefits lefty wing politicians and actors and actresses and influencers withy he algorithm. Many but many of the right wing ones that have over 60k followed on thread barely get 4 likes in their comments or posts. This is so odd. Also the app is freaking boring. I’ve heard this from both right and left.,0
Good,2
Wow ❤👍,2
Please add spaces I would love to see spaces in thread 🧵,2
Good,2
Useless app.. no meaning of using this app.. this is made only to have some competition with Sir Elon Musk,0
This is good app same as twittar bit the size of this app is big,2
"Dreadful privacy standards, and the feed is just a bunch of random strangers I don’t care about AT ALL.",0
Useless!!! After installing it a couple days ago it logs me out of both Threads & intagram! Plus keeps asking me to log back in! Never happened before with insta for many years! Uninstalling both.. wish I could give it zero ⭐'s Going back to Elmo's app!,0
Kinare !,2
A really good app better than twitter,2
"Threads features a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. The app's design is minimalistic, placing the focus on conversations and ensuring a distraction-free experience. From the moment I started using Threads, I found it effortless to locate and engage in conversations.",2
Competition of Twitter 💥🤯,2
You need to show how many posts a user has and how many reposts a post has.,1
Goood,2
Good very experience great hard working,2
Good,2
Wow like it's,2
🤷‍♂️,2
Nice app,2
"Vidéos on my Threads app has not been talking, just watching movements but couldn't hear anything even after trying out different buttons that could help.",1
Good app moreover I like the black and white theme,2
"The moment I finished my login, the threads(?) on the page immediately overlap with each other. Same goes on search page, profile, and notification. So it create some kind of ripple threads. I wish this review page have a way to post my screenshot to explain it better. I hope you can improve that and I'll change my review the moment it works for me.",0
Better than anything !!!,2
Right now the only complaint I have is that so many people show up in my feed who I don’t follow. Is this the way it will be or will you fix this?,1
I think this app has 3 months and everyone will forget about it,1
This must be planned as a refuge for people who couldn’t handle free speech and still wear masks in their car. Exact copy of Twitter but with more pics and your feed filled with people you don’t know. Uninspired and and buggy. If you have Instagram this is very redundant. Basic Twitter with some Instagram painted over it.,0
What happened to ig another way to make it hard for people with a little platform,1
the app always force close when want to read some comments,0

Feel nahi aa rahi 🤧,2

Using this platform to blackmail others. It worths nothing. That's the most useless app to ever exist.,0
"I recently had the pleasure of using the Theard app, and I must say, it has completely transformed the way I communicate and collaborate with others. easy-to-use , user-friendly ! *In next update please add the option of adding more accounts like Instagram & double tap to like the threads etc...*",1
Very smooth,2
Good,1
i just love it,2

Very Good app I have Really Appreciate To use this plat Form Am Happy 😊🎈😘,2
Trashapp. Had to sign up twice and still getting banned or under review after i have written the code on a paper received through my email and phone and also took a selfie. Like damn what else is there for a new user to verify lmao. Meta is a sensitive weakarse company who will never be better than twitter. Update: threads finally let me sign up and verification completed. I hope they don't piss others off but I give them 4 stars. Minus 1 star for pissing me off in the beginning.,1

I love this application & after Instagram this application is ky favorite one.,1
"I understand it just released, but there's a lot to improve. Some things I think should be fixed/added: the option to search for tags or words; too many accounts I don't follow on my tl; chat system; stories; show the quotes for threads; allow us to select from gallery folders when selecting pics to post Edit: new issue, the app keeps closing whenever I try to post something",0
Enjoying it so far,2
Nice app.. Buh can't download videos,2
"it's on a good start to be a good socmed app, i just have some problems with it: 1. there is only a for you page, you have to see what the algorithm wants you to see and there's no way to only see posts from accounts you follow. 2. it could he more clear with the data it's taking. simply saying ""other data"" when explaining what data meta takes from us is not transparent. 3. the search section sucks, there is no trending page, no hashtags, and you can only search for accounts",0

"I can't even sign up here iñ Asia. It only have one option for singing up. No email, no google or no other options",0
It’s made by the guy that owns Facebook. Why would you want him to own and sell more of your data?,0

I cant download this app,0
Bagus,2
Sign up at other communities with Lemmy. You don't have to give your info to Meta. This is their scummy attempt to steal your data as part of the fediverse. You have alternatives which don't attempt to scrape your phone.,0
I don't have or want Instagram and there is no other way to log in.,0
Wonderfull.. like a twitter,2
Tiwtter se to accha,2
They out here ready to swoop up the people from twitter after everyone leaves it 💀,2
Really good app it's gonna replace Twitter for sure RIP Twitter,2
I made an account less than 5 mins ago went to follow someone who also made an account today 7/6/23 and they’re already censored….how is that possible? I’m headed back to Twitter. Also the design and layout is awful,0
There is too much glitch.....you can't do anything here neither can see anything its just a blurred world,0
I was super excited to try Threads but i was super disappointed with it. My feed was just full of suggested post of people & things that didn't interest me & that i didn't follow. Hard to find the people i did follow. plus i can't search topic's. I'VE NOW DELETE APP. 😥,0
Very nice app,2
Still very buggy and not usable. Threads disapear. Bio gets synced with IG even after correcting this a couple times. Also not happy with all the permanence of it. Want more control over the data and privacy and data ownership.,0

"""Login with Facebook"" is not an option? Can you imagine if Google launched a new app, allowed you to login with a YouTube account but not a Google account? No?

No freedom of speech. Biased platform. You will get banned when you talk against certain groups. You will get banned when you say the truth. Islamophobia will be defined as freedom of speech though. This happens on all meta platforms. Twitter is the best.,0

"Title: A Game-Changer for Social Engagement - Instagram Thread App Review Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5) Review: Instagram Thread has undoubtedly transformed the way we connect and engage with others on social media. As an avid Instagram user, I am thrilled to share my experience with this remarkable new app. Instagram Thread takes the concept of storytelling to a whole new level, allowing users to dive deeper into conversations and share their thoughts in a more meaningful and organized way.",0
It's better and easy app to use,2
Love it.,2

Threads provides a pleasant experience by moderating extremist and avoiding the toxicity plaguing the bird app.,2
Underwealming. I don't want to see what my Instagram followers are thinking about. Top much antisemitic comments that apparently do not breach their community guidelines,0
Best app 👌👌,2
fun app and better than twitter,2
It's a good app for expressing a good note in insta story,2
Its got hanging while swiping down,1
"Similar, to...., but I enjoy it so far.",2
"It's interesting so far, but a lot of us use desktop way more than mobile apps. It took a long time for Instagram to figure that out, but they finally gave a half-assed desktop version. Threads ought to do the same. Maybe even full-assed. And FB should break the moratorium on parsing Threads links when sharing our profiles. Can't we all get along??",1
It's a collection of your personal information which is sold to anyone who wants your info. They can use it to sell to China and other people who'll use it to harm you and your family,0
Awesome application 💯,1
Better than Twitter 😂,2
5 saal ho gye iss app ko use krte krte ajtak koi dikkat nhi aayi very good application,2
There should be option to connect with Facebook account too,1
Its a useless app i could live my life without it.. its a waste of storage and unnecessary.. twitter is better in my opinion.. not even close,0
Copy paste boring app same Twitter My recommendation Twitter is best,0
Nice app,2
The app crashes when I try to open from this morning.,0

Great app.,2
Great,2
THIS IS FIRST REVIEW IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE,2
Very easy to use. Can you add download button to image in every user threads? Because somehow we want to save the image they sent to us. Overall is great!,2
There is no Direct Message system but better than Twitter👍🏻,2
Good,2
There's no messaging option 🙄,0
It's way better than twitter cause it's easy to go when you're in IG,2

It is a really good application,2
Best then twitter,2
Phone number? Face verification? LoL no.,0
So far soo good💜,2
This is a new app I hope it will be good,0
"For some reason, this app needs access to the following information from your phone: Personal info (even though you'd be providing that yourself) Financial info (excuse me, what?) Health and fitness info (Why?) Messages (Emails, sms, etc) Photos and videos (I suppose it needs access when you want to upload) Files and docs (can you upload files and documents?) Calendar events (is there a built in calendar?) App interactions, installed apps etc Web browser history (What?) Gross",0
"it has the potential to be way better than twitter (which to be fair, it’s not that hard with how it’s current state is under elon) but there are some features that twitter has that are useful that aren’t on threads, for example an indicator on one’s profile saying if they are following you or not, also dms, polls, and many more options that can come in future updates. i feel like it would’ve been smarter to get more features like those in before release date",1

The app is so glitchy that As soon as I scroll the app overlays every post over each other And they say that deleting this app will delete your account,0
Upto now good,2
Good but there should be an alternative to the story as well.,2
Good app,2
Amazimg app,2
Musk and his crew I’m sure are flooding negative reviews for this app.   Don’t let his hurt ego and deflating wallet determine whether you will give this app a try!,2
I got this app bc I thought it would be like Instagram but really it’s just an off brand twitter. It’s boring and laggy. Don’t recommend,0
🌎 - Threads,2
Lets see how many followers I'm gonna get from here my user @arh4mm,2
Better then Twitter tbh,2
Meowwwww🐱,1
Superb Application ♥️♥️♥️,2
Very good ❤❤❤,2

Elon Musk in now days 🙄,1
Great,2
"Constantly crashing trying to upload a photo, otherwise a good place with positive energy",1
Mind blowing 😍,2
Really i'm so excited it's too much good for other third party applications,2
Future App,2
"A welcome option to get away from Twitter, but migration, though painless, comes without a few much needed aspects. Searching by keywords for posts about a subject can't be done. No option to see trending subjects either. And the app does not always keep its last position, resulting sometimes in restarting from the very beginning of your feed. The recent update fixed the jerky scrolling; everything else is pending more updates!",1
Im in already love with this app ❣️,2
"I would love to be able to post to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, all at once.",1
High quality pictures not uploadable cuz it crashes! Annoying 😭,0
BEST FOR ME,1
I NEED A DARK MODE OPTION 😩,0
@chandankumar.360 👑 honest Review 💥💥,2
Need more features,2
It doenst enter my account and keep sayin “Try again later”,0
"I have rated one star cuz actually I haven't used it yet , everytime i open the app it lags and it's terrible I can't use it cuz all things are in each others I can't describe anymore about my problem",0
"Treads app, touted as a social media aggregator, falls short of expectations due to significant privacy concerns and a lackluster user experience. The app demands the deletion of your Instagram account alongside deactivating your Treads account, citing the need to extract all data from Instagram, which they blame on TikTok. This questionable data handling practice raises serious privacy concerns and leaves users in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Moreover, the app's cluttered interface, poor integration, and frequent technical issues undermine its usability and convenience, making Treads more of a hindrance than a reliable social media tool. Proceed with caution and prioritize your privacy when considering the use of Treads.",0
"Launched wayy to early. Missing essential features, content is just Instagram without pictures. If it improves I might rate it higher but for now it's just too bare bones.",0
So far so good but sometimes it won’t display new threads on home page and I wish there was an easier way to save images and videos.,1
"Worse community guidelines than Twitter, can't find pron either.",0

Quite good,1
Very good but please donot limit the letters. It should unlimited.,1

"Sounds simple, clear, and innovative. It would have been better if there hadn't been a footprint of photos and videos.",2
"Large brands get all of the bandwidth and smaller creators get no reach. The scales are tipped way too far.

I was hoping this would be more social and less media.",0
Look like Twitter,1
Why after posting a video on this app does the sound disappear? Don't have this issue on TWITTER......,0
My app is not running clearly,0
Wow Kiya app😍😍,0
Can't login,0
I can't believe Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are fighting for a app like this,0
"Nice app, well done!",2
#tag is missing.,0
Nice,2
"After using threads for a week or two, my account suddenly stopped working.   It is still public.  Others can see it.  I cannot post but I also cannot take down posts.  I cannot deactivate my account.  It’s just frozen in time.  

I’ve wondered if perhaps threads thinks I’m abroad, because I did travel.  But I am back home in NY and was here when this started.   

It’s much more frustrating than if the account had been entirely shut down, because I keep getting notifications that people have written or replies or followed etc, but when I click on the app I cannot see them.  And I cannot post anything to explain it to people.",0
Good,2
Good app ..👍,2
Amezing this app but chat option available in threads app,1

Made an account and instably tons of crap I don’t want to see. I’m about done with all metas sites.,0
i can't save images. So why would even want to use this compared to Twitter,0
Kya Bekar App Hai ye 😭🗿,0
Nice experience,1
"Yes, it's a new app. But Meta is not exactly an indie developer! There is literally no reason to be flooding us with Rando Accounts. That should have been basic functionality from Day 1. But like Instagram, seems Threads just wants to push random posts on us whether we like it or not. Until basic functions are in, I'll be sticking with Twitter.",0
"It works fine as a twitter substitute so far, but every time I try to upload images in my replies, I keep getting error messages saying that my post failed to upload. Yes, I cleared my cache and tried again. The problem still persists.",0
instagrams algorithm works better for me. on tw***** the algorithm shows me things that are harmful to my mental health. on threads i don’t have to worry about that. it’s just cute art that i like. it’s simple. i like this more. i don’t understand the complaints personally.,2
Awesome,2
There’s no way to explore the app. Only see what the people you follow post. Needs a trending page or something like Instagram’s explore page. Little disappointing that it’s not in from the start.,1
"Perfect & Awesome Start,, Go Ahead 💪❤️",2
Instagram is better man,0
Mark vs Musk,2

Great app fast work app I got verified,2
"Horeeee... lapak jualan baru. Dimana ada ramai orang Indonesia, disitu mereka buka lapak jualan. 🤣 Bintang 3 aja, soalnya pasti kotor & kumuh dgn orang jualan.",1
"Still kinda barebones for now, but it's not bad for a new social media app. It def needs some improvement on algorithm and such. Since it's a new app tho, I'll let it slide for now and hope they add more in the future.",1
Great app but no themes Only dark them and there is no data save like autoplay you can't control it to never or something I hope next update trying to fix it,1
Samthing this app is wandarfull warking I am prodof it 🙌,2

"Log in via Instagram only? But it's for adults, business Entrepreneurs... I don't have and won't have Instagram, I don't have time for that",0
"UPDATE: App works perfectly fine since the update. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The app runs fine, but I can't check out my account's Following list, as well as other accounts Following lists either to follow accounts I recognize from other platforms (the same Following list error/glitch has been happening on Instagram, too). Hopefully this error/glitch will be addressed soon in a future app update.",2
"As soon i logined it behave like laging or something like it, even I can't scroll it.",0
"Beautiful app, lots of ppl, zero content",0
Images make the app crash and so I've decided based on it's immature layout that looks like from early 1980's websites ! I'm seriously not impressed with this app .,0

I hope... Will be experienced by threads. Congratulations,1
The app is cool,2
So goodddd,1
Stupid App,0
"Everybody has commented about the features and functionality that are still needed. I assume those will come with time.

I am a little concerned that the app seems to access every bit of private data possible.  The app has private settings, but they are convoluted and not so easy to work through.

The app is also draining my battery like no other app. If I can't figure out a fix for this, I'm not sure I can leave the app installed.",1
I don’t have  Instagram. And I don’t want to use Instagram. So I can’t use the Threads.  What is that? Too bad !!!!,0

Very good,2
It being tied to IG is a deal-breaker — make it a stand-alone entity and I’ll come back and create a user account!,0
Good job well-done by Mark juckarbarg.,2
I like the design of the app. Clean.,2
"How are you supposed to express your views when threads is a meta product. Share an opinion that’s to spicy? Strike. Share another? Strike 2. One more? Shadow banned. That’s the thing about twitter, Reddit and other social media platforms, there’s more free speech less Orwellian “see why fact checkers say it’s false”. Don’t subscribe to metas echo chamber inducing, time consuming, and authoritarian approach to social media.",0
Waste of time,0
"I recently tried out this app and it's not bad but requires some improvements. One major issue is the lack of a clear indication for new posts, making it difficult to stay updated. The app also needs a better layout with clear indications of posts to enhance user experience. Additionally, the mixing of posts and replies without clear separation adds confusion. Despite these drawbacks, the app has potential.",1
Nice,2
So I tried getting onto the app today and it wouldn't let me and instead made me have to do an appeal with verification to prove its me. I submitted it and they just put a message saying thanks and to wait until the appeal is finished being reviewed to see whether or not I can regain access to my account. Says if they find its not me that it will be permanently disabled which is bs! Hope they fix this and let me back on my account!,0
Always stay with meta,2
I love it,2
Woderful,2

Let's see Twitter vs threads 👀,2
Don't mystak,0
Why my feed is white only.?? I hate it,0
copy right as twitter .....,0
Good 👍😊,1
It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.,2
Its pretty average..more like twitter from 2007.,0
Next Twitter,1
UNUSED APP,0
"The best app,I enjoy using it",0
It’s fine but I’m not interested until I can see a timeline of only people I chose to follow.,0
Copycat,0
Loving the app so far alot better than twitter even though their are less features the community is alot better and growing is easier and it is refreshing to have a twitter competitor definitely recommend,2
"Using Threads is a wonderful experience! Though with the flood of company/official accounts randomly on my timeline, it's too similar to other related app competitors. Accesibility with linked photos (ALT Text) is not there like how Instagram does, and there's no PC version to make it easier to bring in those who are used to the feel of making threads similar to, again, other competetor sites.",1
Nice عالی است ❤️,2
Super Best !!!,2

This is better than Twitter.,2

the threads community would REALLY love an inbox where we can reply to peoples threads & have conversations privately.,2
Its so amazing,2
Ita not working in my device after login it buffering while scrolling and showing overlapping post and content.,1
Wonderful,2
Excellent 👌👌,1
"5 Stars because the app is fantastic, I joined the app 7 hours after it was launched and trust me it's really fun to be part of the Threads family",2
I think it's just the same as Twitter,1
No data Saver option to much data consumption,1

Interface error,0
I'm unable to download this app it's just show can't be installed try again 😕,1
Ok.,2
Good,2
Can't see any replies to any threads. It always says something went wrong,0
"I recently tried out this app, and let me tell you, it was a total letdown. Right from the start, the user interface was a mess. I mean, seriously, what were they thinking? It was confusing and just plain ugly. It felt like they randomly threw everything together without any thought for user experience. I was left scratching my head, trying to figure out where everything was.

But that's not all. The app had serious performance issues. It was as slow as a snail on a Sunday stroll. Every tap felt like an eternity, and don't even get me started on the freezing! I'd be in the middle of doing something, and bam! The app would freeze, leaving me frustrated and annoyed.

And here's the real kicker: Threads had this crazy, over-the-top censorship going on. They didn't want anyone to say anything remotely controversial or express any dissenting opinions. Come on! We should be able to have open conversations without being muzzled. It felt like they were trying to control what we could and couldn't say, and that's just plain wrong.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend Threads to anyone. The terrible user interface, performance issues, and heavy-handed censorship make it a complete waste of time. If you're looking for an app that values free speech and actually works well, keep on searching, my friend. Threads is definitely not the one for you.",0
Alon eyes on Threads 😎,2
Thanks for Instagram 😊,2
Achcha nahi Kara app delete Karo ga to Instagram se Id delete ho jaye gii,2
Amazing,2
Nice 👍,2
"I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.",0
Malyaliss N nmskaram 😅,2
Absolutely amazing,2
I know,2
Nice initiative,2
"I thought this would be nifty and I would be able to create an account. Surprise! Unfortunately, that was not an option as my phone number was required that signified I already ""have an Instagram account with that #.""

Good,2
Zuck sucks. Go Elon,0
"Great solution to twitter, fun to scroll through people’s thoughts and news but it’s a new app and you can tell it’s missing features. I think with time it’ll be a fantastic app if it stays afloat. One thing I’d like to suggest is separate tabs to view threads from just people your following and a tab for explore/discovery/for you, also and edit feature would be useful instead of deleting posts if you misspell and one more quality of life feature would be double tapping posts to like it would tie it into instagram nicely. Overall I think it’s a great app and look forward to seeing how it evolves in the future🪡",1
They should add a save thread option asap!!!,1
Wow,2
Just a copy of Twitter. Nothing new or special. I liked the UI btw,0
Og,2
Super,1
"Quick, yes. I will need to be able to curate my feed at some point, but this initial flood of content is a goldmine for businesses! Threads Links from other apps (WhatsApp) don't open to the app. Rather, they open in Chrome! Loss of traffic.",1

Dumb,0
:D,1
Far from twitter.,0
"Great start. It’s similar to Twitter in that it’s short form posts . I hope we can search threads by topic at some point. 

After interacting for a while I have started seeing accounts that interest me. The randomness of what can pop up while scrolling is nice too. 

It’s good vibes compared to similar apps , I hope it stays that way.",1
Better than Twitter 😀. It took me a while to find the app because there is a different app called Threads. I suggest you add a link on Instagram for downloading this app...,1
"I’ve got Suggested Followers toggled off in two places, but my timeline is pure…suggested followers. Absolute unusable garbage, not ready for prime time.",0
Glad this exists because Twitter is on the way out but this should not have launched until they were ready with all features.  No hashtags.  No trending topics.  No searchable topics.  No DMs.  If this is supposed to be a twitter copy but better then make it better!!!,0
Zuck's garbage app,0
Nice,2

It's nice but we cant use two accounts at a time n by this insta is disabling lots of accounts,1

Please add arabic language .,1
Yeah good 👍 👌,1
best app,2
Great,2
Everything about this app is good it’s just the simple fact that since it’s linked to your ig acc that if you delete one you delete the other one and that thought of all my memories and friends being deleted gives me anxiety ! Instagram I hope you work on something to change this or assure us are pages are safe !,1
I am experiencing a blurry display of this App and i cant read the writings and cant see the images. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app thrice but still its not working,0
Good aap,2
@Threads And Better Than Work👍,2
"Unintuitive UI. Restrictive functionality. Content basically mirrors Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. This is not exciting and new, it's just a business venture! Same old social media yawnfest. When is somebody actually going to break the mold and make something fresh?",0
Very good app and easy to use from the stable of metta,2
The app is having a big problem. I have logged in with my Instagram account. But when I scroll down to view people's post it turns white and also glitching. I have uninstalled it and installed yet the problem still remain the same. Although the app is nice but it having problem. Please fix it.,0
Super,2
Everytime I try to comments or reply it kicks me out the app for no reason but anyway I love seeing Zuck actually doing a good favor,2
Very nice app👍,2
I am giving it 3 star because there is no hashtag trend. Neither live streaming option. And comparing to Twitter it's need more features to go ahead.,1

"Anything that has Zuckerberg‘s name attached to it, you gotta be careful about. I don’t think Zuckerberg is a bad guy. I think he’s a good dude actually. But, he doesn’t make the final decisions about what Meta does. A lot of people think he does. He’s just a puppet at this point basically. This app was designed to suppress and conceal the truth. To let the left continue their hidden agendas. And I’m not saying this as a Republican or anything. I’m not. I used to be 100% Democrat years ago. I’m more middle of the road now. But I like the truth, and I like being uncensored. You don’t get either of those on this app.",0

im excited for threads woohoo twitter but good! when i try to reply or post though the app crashes,1
You can’t delete it without deleting your Instagram account. Think twice before downloading this app.,0
The app is very good.,1
Would be awesome to use without not having to sign up for Instagram 😔 wanted something other than Twitter and I'm sure many other people feel the same way,0
L app,0
It looks better than Truth Social an Twitter but still need improvement updates has crash this app few times so needs updates more features,2
BEST APP IN THE WORLD 🌍 RIGHT NOW 😁 POSTIVE REVIEW.,2
I think it's a good app,2
Copy tea copy,0
Amazing 😍,2
Damn,2
"I’m rather liking Threads so far. But there are some things I really want to see and some problems that need to be fixed. 

First, it seems glitchy. I’ve been doing a lot of searching to try to follow people I am following on Twitter and Mastodon. But I get error messages about too many searches.

Second, the feed needs to prioritize the people I follow, and put their unread posts first so I can see them. If you want to follow that with posts you think I might like, that’s okay. But show me posts from the people that follow first.

Hopefully this can replace Twitter for me. It does show a lot of promise.",1

"So many issues. I couldn't see my own profile page, other people page, my replies, notifications, etc. The only thing working for me is the feed, which filled from a bunch of accounts I'm not following.

This is literally the best social platform in the planet earth.,2
"Great potential but some fixes needed. I don't get notifications from some of the people I want to know when they have posted, I can't attach GIFS, I see a lot of accounts I don't follow and don't want to follow and have to spend so much time blocking and muting.",1

I like it😊,2
"Wanted to spite Elongated Muskrat, instead forced to sign up for Instagram just to log in, instead of just a regular sign in prompt, not even a Facebook or Google sign in option. Y'all need to learn from PC gaming that no one wants a dozen different launchers or logins for something as simple as this.",0

"Essentially, this is a worse Twitter/Instagram. No FYP, a less user-friendly UI (user interface). I think the goal was to make it the Instagram version of Twitter, but we already have Twitter. Instagram is its own photo-sharing application, that yes, includes text. Why make an app that is about talking to the public when Twitter does that in its own way with a FYP that is better in every way (via menus, interactions, etc etc).",1
I don't have instagram account... How do i create account on threads?,0
Use less 😒😒,0
Why do I need to see threads of people who I don't follow. It's irritating af. Also too bad that you can't delete threads without deletin instagram.,0
Super,2
Really eager to see the good stuff,1
Wow,2
Stupid app . Need Instagram account to login . No option is given in the app to sign up .,0
Nice ✨,1
wont let me post videos :(,0
If you miss the freedom of Twitter and enjoy living in an echo chamber of your own leftist drool while all you do is spew hate for Trump all day long. This is the app for you if you love being censored and fed nothing but false information this is the app for you.,0

Better than Twitter🔥🔥,2
Boring,0

Nice app! Better than twitter though! 👍👍,2
Very poorly tested and buggy app,0
Twitter for tankies,0

Awesome app neat and clean loved in on the first use My thread is : ivan_hugs_tv,2
Twitter wanna be. Just as expected they are censoring speech and shadow banning accounts that don't align with their views. Delete > uninstall.,0
Why is my feed full of random bs? Why do I even follow people if I can't see their posts in chronological order.,0
Why is the Hashtags not working 😏😏😏,1
There is a bug if you activate your Insta account on thread than you are not able to delete your Insta story,0

"Some sort of static content retention mechanism to show the last seen Thread before closing the app after a re-open would be perfect. New threads should show thumbnail of their publisher's pfp at the top, giving the user the control to go up or go down the feed.",1
"A good first step but many bugs still needing to be fixed. The most egregious is that the on screen keyboard overlays the input area so you can't see what you're typing. Since this is what I would consider a major bug, I'm rating this app accordingly.",0
Zuck ki potty,0
"this is literally the better twitter. the community is less toxic and the app as a whole is just better. there’s way less ads which is also a plus. HOWEVER one of the main problems is in your main feed, there tends to be a bunch of random threads from people you don’t even follow or associate with who you follow. i do understand that this is a new app though and the algorithm is a work in progress which is understandable. one thing i think would make the app a little cooler, and even better than twitter, is if you had app theming, kinda like how you can theme the direct messages on instagram, but instead have it on threads, and have it be the whole app. (it would be really cool to open up a pink threads app 🤭) overall i think the app is really cool, good job 👍",2
Better than twitter,2

very good app but i give 4 star cause this app is copy Twitter,1
"Beside the fact that this app has very sparse feature support compared to Mastodon or Bluesky, I can't see what my friends post here.

What's the point of following someone if I can't see what they post?",0
I really like this app,2

"Let people connect with their words and thoughts. Countless apps let you post and consume pictures, videos, and memes. 

Let this app prioritize spoken word and bring back communication with people. Ban all media except for text, so this app stands out from, cough, its sister app, IG. And, um, Twitter. 

Also, please fix your UI for replies displaying strangely, stop sending me to Instagram to manage my settings on this app, and find a better way to integrate the experience of browsing someone’s profile on Threads and switching to their IG and vice-versa.",0
Really impressive,2
verify me since I’m the first review please 🫶🏾,2
Good 😊😊,1
the data privacy thing is violated through and through. you can really delete a thread account without deleting your instagram account and the deactivate option-- you can deactivate only for a week. it's gives you no real option of leaving this app.,0
Cool must try,2
Excellent,1
Nicee,2
"No point using since I can't customise what I see on my feed. I don't want to see all the possible posts from the multi-verse, only from who I follow. I have zero interest in sports, don't follow anybody in sports, so that showing up is an instant uninstall.",0

"Going on two weeks since public launch now and this app is starting to suffer from lack of very common features (which honestly should have been standard at launch). No ability to filter your feed or search posts/tags. Account follower import seems to be messy for those with a larger following. It has some good things like in line thread adding good media display. But, these are not enough to keep the app afloat on their own.",1

Is it a must to log in with histagram?,1
"Off to a great start! This is a great alternative to other text-based social media! After installing I could import my Instagram profile pic, bio and followed accounts (some of whom are already on the new app). Timeline updates are fast and videos appear to be better quality than similar platforms. My only suggestion is I would like to see a more compact timeline UI or the ability to customize the size of posts so I can read more Threads per screen 😀",2
Good app,2
Can it be more user friendly for someone who wants to thread photos/ videos without scrolling all the way down? It accessed the photos/videos but can it detect the folder/album system of the phone. I hope the new update have this.,1
"It’s a good alternative to the bird app, but it needs far more work:
Search: Have it search users or keywords. Right now it’s just users.
Instagram integration: apparently “follow all” would follow all those I follow on Instagram when they sign up. That hasn’t always been the case and now I’m having to manually go through those I follow on Instagram and find them in Threads and follow them again. They’re also not automatically following me for the same reason. They have to manually find me.
Feed: I don’t mind the curated feed, but allow us to have just those we follow in a separate feed, or allow us to create custom feeds (like Lists on the bird app).
Data: what exactly is “sensitive data”?",1

It seems I can make a post, and I can view the main feed - but search, my page and the likes tab all just give an error message ('something went wrong. Try again...'). It was fine for the first 2-3 days, and given that ever since. Not really useable when the majority of tabs don't even work.",0
This app is so annoying ive had tried to download it multiple times and it literally starts off extremely slow then once i get to a certain percentage it stops the download it has happened way to many times not only that i dont understand why not make it an extention or a part of Instagram INSTEAD OF MAKING A WHOLE DIFF APP its so stupid if ur gonna make a 2nd app at least make it well and fix its issues or let us sign in from a browser online instead of downloading it sense it doesn't even work,0

The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.,0

"The potential is there. However, I'd only want to see people who I follow in my feed and it needs to be on chronological order. Furthermore, it would be nice if, when you open the app, it started where it left off rather than jumping to the top.",1
É feito pelo Zuckerberg tô baixando ! Se o insta é maravilhoso provavelmente esse app aqui também vai ser! 💕,2
Love about app simplicity. easy to use and fun! Meta did good job on this,2
Carry on,2
Zuckerberg is a cunning foxy devil,0
This app definitely has potential. Clean UI but it still has a lot of bugs. Can't post photos or videos right now. Interesting to see where this will go.,1
Twitter copy,1
I don't have an Instagram account so I couldn't create an account.,0
"has potential, but is missing some key features:
-segmented home page (fyp/following)
-followers section
-dynamic resizing (images, replies etc take up identical amounts of space no matter what)
-no tags or categories
-mature section (to edge out Twitter's monopoly on relatively soft moderation)",1
So many bugs,0
Nice app 👍,2

Good app,2
Idk why but the I am suffering from glitches whenever I am opening the app... It's not working properly,0
"It has been a very successful application, it has a few shortcomings, but I think they will be completed. I loved",2

Amazing app,2
We need the dark theme,1
"This is what Twitter wanted to be until they changed their management and ruined it by letting rampant hate. Longer posts, simple engagement, just better Twitter. It just needs to continue to add things like video, gifs and such. Happy with it. Happy to have SWITCHED to it.",2
Great app! I always wanted to stop using Twitter and finally i found a better substitute.,2
The apps are glitching,0
i feel relatable cause it replaced twitter,2
Worst privacy policy! What's the purpose of this app? Not at all the alternative of Twitter! So much additions needed if this app want to become a rival of Twitter!,0

bodied my idol Pelon Pusk,2
"It’s a good app however it needs a lot of work and features that all other social networks have.

1. Chronological home feed so you can view thing in order.

2. For you feed so you ca see only the Threads from people you follow also in chronological order.

3. The ability to view the list of people you follow and ability to unfollow from the list.

4. The ability to view things you liked and favorited as a feed in your profile page.

These are major things that all other social networks have and Threads doesn’t have and for a lot of people that’s a deal breaker. I hope to see these features sooner rather then later because people WILL stop using this app and go back the the app Elon is currently hellbent on killing because there will be no better place.",1

So far so good. Add more features and it will be the best.,2
Emporten app,2
"This app is super smooth. I love everything about it. Would be dope to be able to DM friends on here. The day that happens, Threads will most likely become my 1st app choice. There's a few bugs I hope they crank out, but overall smooth. I would prefer seeing post of people I follow vs seeing a bunch of random checkmark folks & businesses I don't even follow talk nonsense. I'm trying to see what my friends are Threading, not a verified wendys account. 

The only other issue I have is the app keeps force quitting when I try to thread. I try to log out and even reset the app. I've updated the app & updated my iPhone, yet it keeps booting me out the app every single time I try to post a thread. Its super annoying. Makes me not want to open the app and thread when I inspiration to post something. Kills the motivation.",1

Do you know when we delete threads profile & data. One will need to delete Instagram account as well 😞😞😞😞😞,0
Suck this app,0
In it's current state this app is awful! I can't even find any threads that the people I follow might have posted. They are lost in seemingly hundreds of random posts from random people all around the world. I have deactivated my account until Meta gets round to producing an option for you to just see posts from the people you follow!,0
nice app,1
The app is full of weird people and it’s just too much like Twitter. It’s owned by Meta which is becoming more and more of a monopoly. They are reaching into Twitters market space and constantly stealing ideas and doing whatever they want to do. The government needs to do something to regulate big tech.,0
Seems like 90% of the feed is people I don't follow and don't care about,1
It's a pile of trash,0
I get it it's a new apss but too much crash. Also please accept webm format video.,1
Good job really good app 👍,2
Loved it 😄 ig ryzo_8,2

They are working on some quality of life issues and threads. But it works and it’s good and I’ll never be back on Twitter.,1
Good so far. Hoping they keep the vileness of the blue check app away.,2

"the first thread comment , and nice app 👌🏻",2
Niceee,1
Its good experience to threads and good effort for meta team but this step might be crucial more in future but i have confident on you that you will be consistent on your goal❤,2
Main feed is 10% stuff I want to see 90% is random trash from accounts I don't even follow. If I wanted that I'd be on tiktok.,0
Gooood much better than Twitter lol it's simple and good,2

Was looking for a good Twitter substitute. But lot looking to create multiple social media accounts again. Will try Threads again in the future if an IG account isn’t needed.,0
Nice application,2
Great app so far✨❤️,2
Good so far,2
"After a few days, it’s amazing. Yes, there’s still more to be added. BUT people need to realize it takes time and this app isn’t completely finished yet. 
And even tho the algorithm isn’t so good for me, I believe that’ll change at least a little bit when things like hashtags are added!!",1

"Things that should be implemented: - Trending topics - Profiles background image - A ""seek"" button that allows you to see reposts that were made of profiles you blocked. When someone resposts now, it only appears ""this content is not available"" - Search for content, so you can find other people posts - Also a Tab to see the posts you liked",2

It doesn't work smoothly for me,0
i think the app is a great start! one of the things that will be required in order to give space to fan accounts though is to have us be able to easily switch accounts in Threads. You can only sign in/sign out every time - we can't do it smoothly.,1
wasted many hours downloading this app yesterday. Once I went near Instagram my Threads information was not locatable,0
Great! But I keep having a Pop up restricting me from following everyone who followed me please how do I go about it?,2
Likely one of the reasons they only have a mobile app and not a website,0

"It functions almost exactly like Instagram except worse in the way that your feed is literally no one you follow, just a bunch of suggested people. There seems to be little to no option to toggle that, which at *least* IG does. Also come up with a more fun and silly name for resharing posts the way ""retweet"" exists? ""Reposting"" is a completely different concept. Like the right-click save + reupload kind. That would add like a modicum of personality, at least :/",0
"after linking my instagram account to threads, it won't stop crashing when i try to open the instagram app with that account. i can't even disconnect my account from threads without deleting my account entirely ☠",0

No concept,0
Need to improve,1
"As a self-proclaimed professional Twitter user, Threads is cleaner, more intuitive, and less crowded.",2
This is fully bugs in open app I waste of my time and my expectations and net,0
"So far, the app is amazing. I love it for its simplicity and minimalist vibe. That being said, I have a few suggestions regarding the 'following' feature. It's quite hard to check the followers one by one to check whether I followed them already or not. So, aside from the ""'remove"" option, perhaps you can add a feature where we can easily check if we are mutuals with that user.",2

Its a trap 😆😆😂,0

Who told Zuck that having a twitter clone for those who sell their lifestyle and bodies would be interesting? Twitter is for smart people that have something to say. Instagram is for beautiful people that have something to show. I don’t want to read thoughts of pretty girls. I don’t want look at bodies or smart people. They are different markets and zones of interests. The rivalry with twitter is not going to happen Zuck. So no echo chambers and safe spaces for you lefty too ;),0
Very nice 🥰,2

It is a very great app like it so smooth but one thing I don't like they asking for a lot of you data like your health and fitness ..... this one other then that great app room for improvement,1

"Pretty basic in terms of features. Most annoyingly, however, it fills your timeline with crap chosen by its algorithm. I ended up deactivating my account. That said, if they open the app to the fediverse, that would make more connections possible via Mastodon. Would it really keep going in this open direction, though. Facebook and Instagram have been msde to not play well with others, and I've had it with approaches to social media.",0

"God created us. We came from Adam and Eve. They were given choice and decided to ignore God's warning. They disobeyed. They were removed from paradise and were fallen. We have the same nature as them when we are born as humans. Unless we are born again. The only way to be born again is to trust in what Jesus did on our behalf, facing God's wrath which we deserved to face even though He lived a sinless life, even to death. Forgiveness of sins is only found in Jesus's name.",2

Not twitter. Folk like me want to use it away from private and professional lives. Instead you want it linked to our Instagram where we liase with family and friends. Couldn't even set up a different Instagram account to keep my threads away from my personal life - critical for many of us to speak out worry free of consequences in a job or even with family beliefs. Threads will not see the large market of us on twitter who use it in an anonymous way. Instagram with words - useless.,0

Ok good 😊,2
For a new app they really aced it. I’m using this more than twitter now. Twitter is full of posts nobody asked to see and Onlyfans users and xxx. My only thing is that I wish it had and explore page and make it where we can hashtag posts. Im loving it. Can you update it where you can delete the account without deleting IG. I didn’t like that. Other than that everything was a win. Keep going.,1

"Beware you can’t delete this app once it’s downloaded, it will only let you deactivate it and it permanently puts your threads number on your instagram for everyone to see. You cannot  hide the threads number even after it’s deactivated even though it says you can remove it, you can’t. I just wanted to see what it was about and now unless I delete my instagram account and create a new one I am stuck with the threads on there too. In my opinion this is a violation of privacy as anyone can message you. They need to fix this. I would NOT recommend.",0
"Extremely basic, lacks the most simple (and often most important) features an app of this category should have. Half the app is mangled together with IG, you can't really personalize your profile, it's slow, has the same policies as IG, isn't privacy friendly, doesn't have a chronological feed and some of the very few options it does have simply don't work. The only pros I could find is that it looks pretty and is relatively organized, but it doesn't come close to the competitor. 3/10",0

This app isn't so bad for a first launch but there could be improvements like longer videos and no glitches also this app is way better than Twitter because with twitter you can't get as much as you can with Threads plus you can't see who your following or add city and state plus add category or contact options like Instagram otherwise than that this is a great app,1

"Great idea, poor execution! I don't need to see every thread that everyone who has an accoun created, I have no interest in looking at random dogs and pictures of what a total stranger is eating for supper. I only want to see what people who share the same interests as me are posting. In other words... People I follow. App removed, maybe ill try it again some other time. That is when Meta gets their act together. This has a long way to go before it rivals Twitter and thats terrible at best.",0
worst social app you can't creat independent threads account,0
It's good but can it have option of translation,1
perfect 👍😃,2
my experience Yay I really liked the tutor and I am getting a lot of help here to cheat and very good this platform and I am sure it will be better than a best perform tutor. Would like to,1

Still need a lot of improvement can you upgrade apply a google translation/translation,0

"Very frustrating experience. Feed it's full of users I don't follow and don't care for their content. Switching between my company and private accounts forces you to complete sign out and reverify. Picture upload quality is compressed, Twitter images are much sharper. I am hopeful for this app, but it should have never been released as a finished product in it's current state.",0
Twitter better 😁,0
"So far a much better replacement for Twitter. Not perfect, but has infinitely more promise than Twitter.",2

"Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.",0

"Just as the rumors said, it's a blatant Twitter ripoff. Absolutely nothing compelling to the interface or the platform. Everything feels very plain and like a stripped dumbed-down version of Twitter, making me feel like I'd rather just use it instead. If they wanted to make a splash and compete with Daddy Musk, they're failing quite miserably right now. Should've fully polished things up before releasing this half-baked uninspired mess.",0

After I ported over all the accounts I was following to start, I went in and unfollowed A LOT of them (went from ~250 to 50). My “following” list reflects this. Yet I still see all of the same original accounts in my feed, as well as others I was never following in the first place on Instagram (and no, the latter aren’t even showing up because someone I follow replied on their thread). Clearly a significant bug(s) here leading to an awful user experience.",0

"- The UI is a bit clunky. Icons have really thick outlines that heavily compete with text visually. Lines between threads are too thin. - Video players are quite horrible. Sometimes audio never works, sometimes the video perpetually pauses on fullscreen / when tapping the thread. - Most threads I see are from accounts I don't follow. While I think that's good for discovering new accounts upon first launch, I don't see many threads from followed accounts.",1
"The app is obviously working for most users, but I can't load anything except the main top level feed. My own posts history, my notifications, and even replies to anyone else's posts all fail to load. Oh, also whenever I try to post, it instantly fails.

Music for stories is also important to express oneself. I just hope the effect on the Instagram app is just temporary.",0

"Got fed up with Twitter and decided to use Threads. I already have an account on insta so the sign-up process was smooth which is appreciated. If you’re familiar with how Twitter functions, Threads is similar and will be easy to pick up. 

Some stuff I’ve noticed that I hope will be added soon: “search engine” is nonexistent, hashtags don’t work (cuz there’s no “search engine” I’m gonna assume), and if you wanna plan out future posts you can’t. Idk if it’s due to this being an early version of the app and it not being completely finished + not wanting to be super similar to Instagram + wanting to differentiate itself from Instagram since all those features are available on that app but it would be nice to include them in Threads. Pls add these functions to Threads! Thanks in advance",1

"The app in itself is ok. However, there needs to be a separate page for posts ONLY from people that I follow show up, none of that stupid algorithm recommending me some random accounts. There should be a sort of “explore” page for the algorithm to be implemented and suggest any content including from accounts I don’t follow and another page only for posts from those I follow. There should also be a mechanism to get rid of bots and spam accounts easily and quickly as I have already seen many bots under several posts. This is an issue that Twitter suffers pretty badly from and it looks like threads is going to as well.

Allow gif replies too. Also should allow replies to be hidden from followers👍🏻",1

Extremely bad. No way to to have a feed with just people you follow. It's all awful influencers and brands posting the dumbest garbage you've ever seen. I'd rather watch my dog take a dump than look at this app.,0
"Wow , only 1.5 hour me 1 million user complete kar liya... Jo ki ab Tak ka no 1 record ban gya hai. Chat gpt ko 1m user bnane me 5 day laga tha..... 🔥",1
"First make this app to adapt themed icons for Android 13 (Google Pixel) and INSTAGRAM TOO.... Please sort out the Home Page. I want similar home feed like twitter (Following and For You). Dont make this home feed like Instagram Home Feed, full cluter. Threads need what is trending right now, '#' has no value right now",1
This is the best app I ever seen it's if it is already leading up wow wow wow thanks at threads,2
We need a live and close friends for this separate app from,1
Text mix for full screen then nothing showing,0
i like it I think it will be very good if it adds the ability to categorize the threads.,1
This is amazing all,2
I love ❤️ it,2
"Waste of time , because of this app , I can't open my Instagram account it's showing that account is crashed 😭",0
New thing great 👍🏻,2
Very nice app 🤠👍👍,1
This app is change your life Elon Musk v/s meta chalange,1
The app is pretty good,2
"It’s been years now and still no app formatted for the IPad, neither Instagram or now Threads. This is a sign that social media is not to feared. How will social media take over the world if they can’t even design an app for big screen mobile users. I still have to suffer looking at Instagram with a screen smaller than my cell phone display. It’s not like Meta can’t afford to pay some brainiac for what could be a half an hours time to make the screen bigger. They’re making loads of cash.",1
Crashing so much,0
I like it 💘🥰🥰,2
"This app is terrible. Why on earth I am supposed to see what lots of people, I am not following, are writing about? Also, why can't I create an account separate from my Instagram account?",0
"So far it seems like a similar concept to twitter , let's see how long it is wholesome and lighthearted..",2
Good app,2
There is a bug when following at home and following directly on the account profile,1
👌🏽👌🏽,2
Twitter lol,1
this app will have so many ads later on just like other META apps.,0
Excellent,2
Boring UI interface app,0
Osm,1
Not good,0
"I find the UI does not clearly separate the messages and particularly which messages are part of a conversation. I have also found the app gets stuck updating and randomly crashes. It would also be useful if when I block someone, they are also muted rather then having to select both. I have had to remove a lot of people and companies I don't want in my timeline.",0
👍👍👍,0
Fun. Simple. Easy to use! Similar to twitter but honestly more user friendly! Can sync with your IG and transfer all the folks you’re following. More writing less pictures,2
Very nice,1

Amazing app. It needs more clutter and improved UI. And don't forget to add Dark Mode.,1

I am the one who downloaded it first,1
Lose. Eeee,1
Disgusting,0
It's alright tho I would suggest to add a dark mode option because it burns my eyes out at night,1
Let me be the first to thread😉😉😉,1
Kmaal ki application ❤️,2
Add auto translate since an app like this is more likely to letting people from different countries socialize with each other. Just keep improving! I'm boutta leave the other app cuz they ask for money to get extra features. 🥲,2
"Spent hours scrolling on this app, no fear of being constantly cancelled like Twitter. A real safe space for philosophical thought. I would say that threads is better, it’s more like a mix or Reddit comments and Instagram combined. It’s the best social media and it’s been pretty positive so far. I hope it stays that way and there aren’t trollls that take over like instagram and Twitter.",2
"Ok, descent , page design is not that good, yeah can do better, include double tap like, and it seems so many threads at one place, improve,... Btw app motive is good",1
It is the panic app,2
I'm very Happy,2
Out with the old in with the new. Downloading and using threads feels positive and refreshing even a little cozy ☺️. I think this app has the potential to be a safe place for expression worldwide.,2

Better than twitter 😉,2
Needs a following-only home page or a better home suggestion algorithm. Maybe it just hasn't learned what content I like.,1
If you want to be better and compete with Twitter you have to have Trending Topics. Newsworthy stories not just celebrities posting. That's what made Twitter famous because people came there to see what was going on in the world.,0
The rich vs. the rich. Wait until they talk of data security. It's a game of Thrones!,1
Nice app,0

Bas yahi dekh na baki tha,2

"I'm grateful that someone has created an alternative to the mess that Twitter has become, and Threads is looking promising. It's early days yet, so I expect changes, but the App desperately needs the ability to show Threads from people I subscribe to, and in chronological order of their posts. The interface is clear-ish but definitely needs work. No ads yet! Unfortunately, I've been followed by 'Sexy Susan' who has zero followers and a risque profile pic so I think the bots are active already.",1

Nice saps 👍😘,2

Just Instagram clone!,0
Threading all the applications.....,2

"I like the app but the amount of things it “needs” access to should be against the law. It’s app wasn’t even approved in the EU because of the privacy concerns. I have never seen an app with a list of access so long! I’m very concerned that meta will be collecting and selling personal and identifiable user data. This needs to be addressed, especially after the TikTok “ban.”",0

"This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.",0
I thought it's a chating app but problem we can't delete because my insta I'd will deactivate 😔😔,0

"There's a bug when using this app on Galaxy S23 Ultra. When i open the app, on home screen it's showing blank and only displays bottom icons . When i click on other icons they are responsive. I thought it was a slow network issue, tried to rest the phone but nothing. I hope this will be addressed via an update.",1
"All I see is influencers and celebrities. That’s it. That’s all you’re pushing on everyone! I rarely see a post from someone I actually follow, and they do post because I can go on their page and see the new ones, you just don’t show it. Ridiculous.",0
Bad,0

"Tweeting didn't connect your private thoughts to family and friends, but with Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, those opinions can be linked. That kind of control over information can cause divisions between you and your relationships, with potentially malicious intent. The lack of originality and copying of Twitter's model merits one star.",0

I deleted the app after two days. You get too many threads from people I have no interest in following. To get rid of those threads you have to block each one individually. The app should allow a user to start with who the user wants to follow.,0
so good ✔️❤️,2
Twitter is very good 👍 then threads,0
This is great. I can’t wait for it to be better. The only thing: could we have split feed? One for the people you follow only and other feed is “popular” or whatever. That way Threads would be cleaner and much nicer to use.,1

Threads is a very amusing and entertaining app although adding more features would be welcomed 👍🏻,2
Worst app,0
"First of all, this isn't a standalone service, it requires an Instagram account. Second, never forget that Facebook sold 86 million users data to Cambridge Analytica to manipulate the elections, and they're being sued in Europe for anti privacy practices. They are going to steal all your information and sell it and use it for nefarious purposes. By using this app you are as guilty as they are.",0

"I like the concept of the app, but I'm having issues with my timeline, it's not showing me the accounts I follow, no matter how many times I refresh the timeline, it shows me random accounts that I don't follow, and it's not because the users I do follow are reposting their threads, it's just giving me random accounts. I want to see the accountsI follow, I specifically didn't tap the ""follow all"" button when setting up my account because I wanted to follow specific people. Please fix this issue",0

"The app is too good as Twitter, and especially the app is connected directly to other Social Media apps but one thing to come in view is that the app contains many and confusing steps to SWITCH ACCOUNT. Look to Instagram and other Meta apps that contains easy and normal way to switch account quickly. Otherwise the app is amazing. My regards to Mark Zuckerberg 🙏",2

A filter option for your page so you see the people you follow threads and not random people. Also support for in app gifs rather than having to download gifs and then adding them to your threads.,1
Not bad from the first glance..,1
It's a good app but no free speech. It sensors and removes almost everything including memes. Why would you sensor our opinions and want us to accept opinions which are against the basic truth? It's sickening 😒.,0
This app is good,1

Something new always appreciated,2
"The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..",1

"I like the simplicity of this app but there's definitely some bugs that need to get worked out. After choosing to sync with IG accounts I follow I weeded through them but about 1/3 that I unfollowed reappeared. I've done this 3x, closing out app to refresh, it keeps happening. Also, home page is super slow to refresh and posting a thread or reply is very slow to publish & sometimes freezes. Also wish that when trying to post a pic/video that one's device folders would appear & not just Gallery.",1
There's no way to view posts from just the people you follow. The home page is like 95% random people that nobody cares about,1
It has neglected the importance of privacy by openly writing in terms that they can share our data to companies for further requirements or something..!,0
Just another tool to collect more data from you.,0

Pretty mid - concept is cool for those who basically want a PG/clean version of Twitter. Doesn't have direct messaging so no chance of strangers trying to scam you or sending you porn. But it links to your Instagram account so you can't delete your threads profile without deleting your Instagram profile too. Hopefully this mechanism will be scrapped and soon else I can see the app crashing and burning. But you can however deactivate the threads account without it impacting your Instagram.,1
Nice app,2

"So as none of you will know I had an issue where threads would crash upon replying to a post or creating a post, well the issue was fixed, but to be honest I don't feel like it deserves 5 stars, that's because it's still an app in development and could use some upgrades, like DM's, translating posts and replies, being able to lookup gifs within the app and the list could go on and on, but overall it's a pretty good start",1

It's good app but is not Useful,1
I heard everybody talking about this app so I downloaded it. At the beginning it seemed ok but after a while I had to start blocking A LOT of people and mute their comments because off the content. It is very frustrating spending a lot of time doing that. There should have an option to select what you want or not to see or have on your account. I’ll deactivate it until that’s fixed.,0
This app is totally useless Twitter is totally better than this app,0
What's the additional value of this platform? Nothing,0
Not working while uploading images.,0
No option to sign up with email. 👎,0

Mejor que Twitter con Elon Musk,2

Looks like a high school kids' summer project. Terrible junk presented on timeline.,0
"In typical fashion for this company, Threads shows you everybody that Meta wants you to see instead of who you want to see.

Such a waste! I don't think we need Threads. It has absolutely nothing to offer. Instagram is more than enough. It's just a weaker version of an ordinary social media app. Want to delete my account but that will instantly delete my Instagram account too. That's very bad and cheap tactics.

I don’t want to see random accounts. Make a home feed for followers or this app is trash,0
I regret making the account. Its a less than half baked app. Launching an app this hyped and lacking as many features as it does is laughable. “We’ll get to it” isn’t acceptable to me. It has zero personality of its own other than being a busted twitter clone. It smells of being built in about a month under a crunch deadline and shipped out to the app stores to try and meet some kind of shareholders goal with the mentality of “make it better at some other point” at the forefront.,0

Needs work. The algorithm curated timeline only shows me two or three things from people I follow before switching to random things from strangers I'm not interested in. This app desperately needs a chronological timeline of just people I follow. Still gets 3 stars just for making Elon Musk cry and pee his pants.,1
There are many problems which I want to address. 1) No themed icon support on Android 2) you can't insert from clipboard if its an image. 3) you can't add gifs and only thing you can add is attachments and that opens gallery. 4) username can't be distinct from Instagram. I use Instagram and Twitter for different audiences so it doesn't help. 5)App doesn't support 60 fps video upload. 6) No button to jump to DM with any one.,0
worst app👍,0

"I’m not that impressed with it or the format.  It just reminds me too much of Twitter, which is a toilet bowl of toxicity.  This is heading in that direction already.  They need to create something that’s all good and doesn’t just feed the verified influencers.  It allows everyone to be verified.  It treats everyone equally.  It doesn’t shadow ban, but it also doesn’t shows you threads of people you don’t even follow nor are interested in, which is what it does now.  Someone like a Jennifer Aniston merely posts a hand wave and 400,000 people click like.  (Rolling eyes here).  How about you create an app that actually shows really great content.  People with something of depth and substance to say.  We don’t need another Twitter sound bite app.  As I said I wasn’t impressed with this.",0

"Good. But, needs improvement. App keeps crashing when I try to post a photo. I am inundated with threads from people I am not even following. Meanwhile, I am not able to see threads from people that I am following. The app should have an option, like Twitter, where you can hide any attached media in threads from people that you are not following. Another option that I would like to see that Twitter had, is the ability to turn off rethreads from people I am following. I like to see direct posts.",1

"It’s like Facebook and Instagram had a baby…oh, wait, they did, and now there’s even more accounts popping up that no one in their right mind would ever follow.",0
"Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.",0
I will give 3 stars for now since it was just released recently. But one problem I have is the amount of random posts from the followed accounts from the people that I follow is annoying for me. I hope there will be an update soon for controlling your newsfeed and improve users' interface.,1

Threads is a spin-off app from Instagram that focuses on conversations rather than visual content. You can log in with your Instagram account and share text updates and join public discussions. And the same is an app that messes with Twitter. Its owner is Mark Zuckerberg. ...THANK YOU...,2

"If i could give it 0 stars I would. There are so many issues with this app. First of all, I couldn’t be logged into instagram and threads at the same time without getting automatically logged out of the other. The app in itself is poorly made, they made it so simple that it ended up not being user friendly. Forcing you to connect it to an instagram, keeping the same username,(some people enjoy privacy!), and impersonal timelines that are filled with unfunny verified accounts that are impossible to get rid of no matter how many you mute. You can’t even follow enough accounts you like to keep the stuff you don’t like off your timeline. Tried deactivating my threads account, not only will it not fully deactivate but you can’t remove the badge on your instagram no matter what you do, even though it tells you that you can. It just pops back up every time you restart the app or change tabs. I feel like i’m being forced to participate in something I no longer want to be a part of. This is such a terrible app I can barely put it into words. And to think that verified accounts had it before me and it still has all these issues is shocking. Very disappointing. Basically, if you like twitter, avoid this app. If you don’t like twitter, avoid this app. Even my LovenseRemote app is made better than threads.",0

"Threads does what it’s intended; it’s a nice, emerging alternative to Twitter, with all of the infrastructure and ease of use ready to go. But there’s things it could do better. 

First of all, the app’s functionality is smart. As I wrote, the friction is nonexistent, and it’s almost too easy to integrate all of your platforms. I love the idea of this app being decentralized, and I hope that’s something that Instagram develops well, as decentralization can make further integration even easier and eliminate issues peculiar to other platforms. 

I didn’t attempt the other alternatives (I last accessed Mastodon perhaps in 2018 and so my opinion is invalid there), but because I already have Instagram and an honest Instagram following, this was the easiest with the least friction to jump into. As a result, I can’t compare Threads to anything but Twitter. And among the features it’s most missing is Twitter’s feed curation. 

 Social networks thrive when they give us greater choice in terms of what we desire to consume. I don’t desire to read the posts of vapid celebrities when my only use case for this type of social network is sports, a handful of other niche interests, and seeing what friends are interested in or talking about. Instead, we see people who are famous for being famous. According to some who disliked Threads, this is where they fumbled the ball, and so they likely could have drawn even more engagement than the incredible numbers they have drawn already if their feeds were a blank slate or correlated with the feeds they already curated on Instagram via a recommendation algorithm. If they replicate Instagram’s feed presentation with fewer interstitial posts (or Threads), and replicate Twitter’s function of being able to follow and engage with Topics that you enjoy, and develop thus a feedback loop of similar content to fill your feed instead of people you don’t know (or at least have them relegated to a separate Recommended tab), this could be infinitely better than even Twitter. I would also like for Threads to retain its small–user feel; everyone feels important, and that’s cool. Allow us to have a chronological order to our feed as well, or even reverse chronology, if we’re interested in that sort of thing. A dark mode for those whose smartphones aren’t set in dark mode. Better presentation in Settings would be great as well; it’s a bit of a mare’s nest at the moment. Provide us with more rational choice. 

I’d like to see the implementation of a separate tab with local, regional or national news, similar perhaps to Facebook (which I haven’t used since 2014 and so have no familiarity with) as well as Twitter, and that’ll make it even better. Avoid replicating where Twitter has gone objectively wrong, too — such as a two–tiered hierarchical system in which individuals who pay a fee have primacy and those who don’t have none. A better, less clunky GUI similar to that of Instagram’s breezy, sleek GUI with old Twitter’s level of order and presentation, as well as Threads’ simplicity, would be great. Better video functionality would be great, too. I already know Instagram is great at developing and integrating new features; I can see a Communities feature á la Telegram. (Please allow us to exercise consent and choice with respect to future gimmickry.) 

I edited this paragraph after some two to three hours of use. Accessibility is important — and that’s what Threads is missing at the moment. Instagram does accessibility relatively well with captions, alt text, and translation. Perhaps even integrate tone indicators. I can imagine how a person who doesn’t speak English would feel acute linguistic isolation here.

Another choice they can give us is in the customization of not only our feeds, but also our accounts and user experience. This also includes empowering us with the choice to retain data we choose not to share, and thus not only address preexisting privacy concerns (another valid concern about this app), but also allow for expansion into the European Union. Allow us to import posts from other platforms (which I believe fediverse governance will certainly facilitate), or even export them from, say, Twitter. Allow us to have our own display names and other customizable presentational features; allow us to deactivate without having to deactivate our Instagram, or even allow us to delete our accounts off Threads, and don’t force Threads onto Instagram users who only have interest in or provide imaginal content on Instagram. Give us choice and power. Develop a unique identity in which the user is king of his destiny, not ruled by an algo’s nudges and whims. And you’ll have a winner — a true “Twitter killer” in which Twitter is reduced to “the other app.” 

I see this being a great app, but it really depends on the people at the helm and product managers listening to consumer feedback (including mountains of consumer feedback from Twitter’s failures over the years as well as looking within to its parent company’s other subsidiaries and their failures) and constantly improving. Color me skeptical; I have no reason to believe any company will do the right thing, but I’m welcome to being proven wrong, because this surely has everything going for it — and, as far as I see, it’s all going in the right direction.

Twitter was important for me, not only for sports and social integration but also especially for news during natural or unnatural disasters, especially since my city’s local news base has declined drastically despite us being especially vulnerable to tornadoes, floods and violence. Twitter’s decline and self–inflicted technical difficulties has complicated all of that privileged access. Threads can not only step in that breach, but also mend it — and not only for me, but for tens of thousands of others. So far, I and many others can see the Sun rising for Threads. Now, it’s up to you all at Instagram to keep the ball rolling.",1

I love the karma bots giving the app glowing reviews like they do with every app no matter how bad or outdated it is. I can't use Threads on Tablet or log in. It's not ready for Android. Besides the only way to close your threads account is to delete your ig account as the two are linked. Other option is to create a new ghost ig account just to use this app.,0

"#1 This app needs an easier way to transfer the same people you follow on Instagram to the app after  your profile is already created 
#2 there should be a way to accept all the follow requests and follow back anyone who followed you who you follow back on Instagram 
#3 on the notifications tab make a tab for only new follows !

Those are the 3 things I’ve noticed within 5 minutes of downloading that this app needs",1
Really well made,2
I will try it first and make my review,1
You have to open an Instagram account to access this. Why it isn't open to Meta users who already use Facebook and WhatsApp is beyond me. Surely one Meta log in would be sensible?,0

"The look and feel is great.  There are many features I like, but my biggest concern is my feed.

My feed is 99% random people and celebrities I don’t follow and only 1% people I follow.

I have followed a large ground from this community, but my feed is full of politics, celebrities, and accounts I have no interest in.

How can I just have a feed of people I follow?",0

Twitter but with more censorship and worse interface. It is altogether a very bad app and I would not recommend downloading it. You have to have instagram to even get into the app which is a pain. They will also deboost your posts and censor you from seeing others. Slow to load too. Stick with twitter as it is a much better app. Very bad do not recommend.,0

"My main problem with the layout of this app is the same as my problem with Twitter—the wayyy to unorganized, you can’t find what you’re looking for. Right now your profile has 2 tabs, a main one and a replies one. I’d love it if there were 3 tabs instead of two: 

• Chat (text posts)
• Gallery (Videos and photos)
• Social (Replies, quotes, reposts).

—

      Then you can also add search filters to find posts that fall under one of those three tabs, instead of just searching accounts. This way you can’t neatly organize the blog aspect, the social aspect, and the artistic aspect! In my opinion this would make it MUCH more user friendly. That way when I want to look at my favorite artists work, I don’t have to scroll through hours of ended conversions or reposts. If I’m looking for a topic to talk about, I don’t have to scroll through pictures to do it. It would also mean I could quote and repost other people’s stuff more without worrying about burying my own work/making my page impossible to navigate. Other than that it’s looking pretty good so far!",1

"I really like this app, it’s like a combo of Twitter & Insta bc we can upload more than 4 photos in a post & don’t have a counter limit lol. 

The only thing that would make this app complete is working hashtags & DM’s",2
"It's owned by Zuckerberg, so nah",0
My issue has been solved.,2
It's time to say bye to Twitter.,2
"Nice, User Friendly UI",2
🦎,2
By far the worst app I've ever used. Like a wishapp version of Twitter.,0
"I’ve gone through the prompts and tried to delete my account as well as my badge multiple times, and it keeps showing up on my profile. This is not cool.",0
Cool,2
"you have yourself to thank, elon.",2

cool app and all but let me remove that stupid badge from my IG it won’t go away even when i click hide badge,0
"The data collection on this app is SINISTER. The user agreement has the same function as Facebook where they literally own your images and content, and can use it commercially. Now I can't delete it without deleting my instagram! If you are an artist, avoid this app at all costs. Everyone else, go into your phone data alloance settings and turn off all data allowances for the app. It won't stop the data mining but it might help. Very dangerous for user security.",0
Meh this app sucks Twitter better,0
"Gak usah install ini, ini aplikasi gak jelas, mending fokus di twitter aja",0

Great 😃👍🏻,2
I would consider giving it an extra star if it adds more features. Although it won't be five stars because the community standards are rubbish,0
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮,0
I was really excited for another platform to use but when I got on it was just a copy of Twitter but with less features. I’m really disappointed in the Threads app I think Instagram should’ve just added it within Instagram instead of making a whole new app that no one’s going to use,0
do this app is pretty good and there really isn’t anything too bad about it.. it’s like twitter but somewhat better. anyways i think the biggest issue is that if you want to delete your account on threads you have to delete your instagram account too.,1
Really poor experience. It also requires an Instagram account.,0
Similar to Twitter .. We want something new.,0
When I scroll down it has Glitches. I downloaded 3 times and same story.,0
I don't know how I'll get my followers but it's good app for time waste 😝😝,2

"Banned within 30 minutes. Hadn’t even posted anything besides “threads needs dms”

You also can only use it if you have an instagram. Which I never had one. Made one just to see and boom banned in 30 mins on launch day. Sad.",0
I'm the First review sheesh,2
"Okay Markus and the Threads crew, listen up. I NEVER write reviews, so you know I liked this app. I don't wanna have to come back and lower it, so hear me out: KEEP IT SIMPLE. From what I can tell, the main draw for a lot of people is the simplistic interface, and how clean and refreshing it feels to not be bogged down by engagement. PLEASE KEEP THAT. Obviously Threads isn't in its final form, but something about it is special 😭 Please be careful. Thassit, be easy, y'all ✌🏽",2
can’t get into my instagram now because it kept making me log in everytime i went from thread to instagram. now when i try to log into my instagram it says “please wait a few minutes before you try again.” I don’t get why thread is connected to instagram in the first place.,0
Good app,2
"I loved the app very cool for everyday life, and excellent settings ❤️❤️",2
To delete your thread account you have to delete Instagram account 👎,0
Worst app all time 😡😡😡😡😡😡,0
Hmm it's a very nice app,2
Bug terus ketika lihat reply di dalam reply.. semangatt,0
"The idea behind this app is great! It's quite convenient that it's connected to Insta account. However, experience with it can be improved. Majorly, by changing algorithms of feed to only view Threads of accounts you follow, or by adding a feature to filter your feed manually, to choose whose threads to see. Hope this feedback will be taken into account 🙏🙏🙏",1
Threads app..❤️❤️,2
Worst app. What you are building guys. Instagram + Facebook= threads. What's a worst product idea guys. Same as 2 repos you are merge and building a 3rd app 😆😆😆,0

"I love it,very smooth app",2
"It's the same mentality !!! In face book & Instagram they just give priority in searching and suggestions to sexual profiles which attract teenagers. I think the same mentality is control Threads also. Mark Zuckerberg found his way by using the nudity to increase his Apps users. Recently, I considered Facebook and Instagram as a Sexual sotes and I thought that they may do something deferent in this new app, but it seems no deference. Twitter is my best App 👌",0

Only thing I’m loving about the thread app is no messaging feature. Only threads. Keep it simple please 🤌,2

"Terrible in terms of privacy and lacking many essential features, such as a timeline for just those you follow.

This tried to be an alternative to Twitter and failed miserably. So many bugs on this app,0
It's good to have such a space to share your thoughts and create your content with words instead of media .. But I think that the home screen is too messy .. you gotta lower the count of non followed accounts threads in the home screen.,1

It's a shame because I'd love to actually engage with the platform but I can't do that if it keeps crashing like this. If there's any way to fix this that I haven't tried, please let me know 🙏",0

"Really enjoying this app. I LOVE that it’s nothing like Tik Tok and that there’s less videos in my feed. You don’t feel like you’re just scroll, scroll, scrolling all the time. One thing I wish they would change is for my feed to not consist of people I don’t follow. I want my feed to only show the accounts I follow. Other than that, I think this app is a hit.",1

"Like many people have said, I’ve been wanting something to replace twitter for a while and so far this is doing a good job at being that platform. I don’t like, however, that my feed is flooded with meme accounts already, and I don’t see what my friends are posting. I’m sure my friends are not posting much, with it being such a new app, but the millions of memes in my homepage ensures I will never see them. It would be nice to have the home feed dedicated to just who you’re following, even if there’s nothing new for a while, and have the search page be for meme accounts and such. Or maybe a “posts you may like” page or something. If I wanted to see a bunch of garbage on my feed I would go to Facebook. I guess I’m just hoping for something more personal and focused on people I actually know.",1

"My review can improve over time, but it needs alot of improvement... It crashes alot and shows some annoying things on my screen. Alot of un delivered post keep appearing on my screen and it's annoying.. I wish I could share my screen so you can see it",0
"As an advocate of free expression and an ardent believer in the power of open dialogue, I found the experience of using the speech-controlled social media app nothing short of a regressive nightmare. Instead of fostering an environment that encourages diversity of thought and robust discussions, this app imposes a heavy-handed system that curtails individual liberties and stifles meaningful interactions.",0
Glitch is one word for this. Couldn't use and explore the app due to shaking screen that pops up while scrolling.,0
Timeline is filled with random people I don’t follow. App is pretty much unusable.,0

New thread It was good option for Twitter 😀,2
This app will be helpful for the peoples who are you twitter because everyone knows what's happening this app will be competitive for twitter,2

"It's good app but it should be more better if you add hashtags, Trending section. some time it automatically throw you out from the while scrolling.

"Much comfortable to post and much simple and minimalist design, great app and i hope it updates more features",2
My problem with this application is that I can only login through my Instagram account but I wanted a separate account for promoting my YT channel and I thought this would be a great opportunity. Apparently not.,0

"Features lacking in Threads that I need to fully switch from Twitter: 1) Search: I want to be able to search for words and topics, not just users. 2) Profile search: I want to be able to search through my own past Threads. 3) Desktop website or app: I want to use Threads on my laptop. 4) Drafts: I want to be able to draft a Thread or Reply. 5) Scheduling: I want to be able to send a Thread or Reply at a later date and time.",0

it's great to have a twitter alternative but scummy that they don't promote news,0
The best so far,2
Threads are great and easy to use.,2
This is a good app I love the layout and all this is made to be a bit more private… no trend page.. can’t really see who you following…can’t add pictures customed like Instagram… these are all great things! The app could use a few updates like all apps do but nothing major.,2
Twitter account deleted and Threads account created.,0
Can't pick a new username. It's automatically the one from Instagram. Also this app has 4599 ratings and nobody bothered to write a comment? Guess you can buy anything these days.,0

Comparing this app with other apps developed by meta this app needs more time to reload the page which makes me feel uncomfortable I checked my internet and phone but still sometimes it take time to reload The main page.,1
"No dark mode toggle. No alt text. No DMs. One main feed with public mixed in. No pinned posts. App feels very simple and basic with bare bones, which is less than most startups have had. This app is unusable.",0

"The developers have already said that this app is a work in progress. Let's hope it gets better than Twitter and simplifies text based posts. At the current stage, the user interface is easy and beautiful. A lot of famous Twitter profiles have already moved to Threads, so it's not lonely here. The biggest issue is that you see posts from accounts that you never followed! It's very very annoying.",2

"new disease to latch onto your phones, yeah !!! thnx zuccu",1
I see the appeal to leave the bird app but that's no excuse to roll out a half baked app. Search is not functional at all. No hashtags to find related or trending content. Videos with audio should unmute when I tap on them to play. No GIF support in posts. There's so much that needs fixing.,0

"Good for early days, a bit glitchy and lots to build on still. In the middle of writing a post, the app closes down entirely and looses the content so I'm having to write it in my phone notes. If you write a long post, your phone keyboard is in the way as the Threads text box doesn't shift up the more you write, so you can't amend mistakes or text. I'm seeing a heck of a lot of posts from people I don't follow at all and have no interest in. A familiar, simple app though so I like it so far.",1

Complete Joke. Twitter is way!!! Better than the data mining meme aka this instagram app without pictures nonsense.,0
"This app does not support keyword search. As an active Twitter user, this is a showstopper, and the app is next to useless for me. Having that feature currently in the pipeline is understandable, but the fact that Meta decided to hype a beta version just to gain momentum over Twitter is embarrassing and disappointing.",0

More like insta and doesn't look like it had more of idea to be created I can edit my review based on changes brought by Meta but for now ... it just looks like insta without reels,1
The app is soo bad don't install it because if u install it and then u wanna to remove ur account or the app you will remove the instagram too automatically so if you install it you can't remove it and twitter>>>>>,0
"Extremely poor user experience, the app kept logging me using insta. Even after insta app was uninstalled. App removed from phone.",0
جامد فشخ ❤️❤️,2
The worst app I have ever experienced.. Despite providing correct log in details this app is showing incorrect password...I am utterly shocked having experienced this from a reputable and top company like meta.,0
"Threads has the potential to be great, and I really want to see it becomes just that. I’m not a tech bro, but I’m a chronically online user who uses platforms like Threads for leisure and work. Here are a few additions that I think would set Threads apart and totally dislodge any and all competitors:

- DM that’s connected to (same as) IG
- Stories (+ crossposting)
- Option for chronological/following-only newsfeed
- Hashtags
- Trending (or Threading 👀) topics
- Option to save/bookmark threads
- Option to edit threads
- Option to add folks to lists of favorites (this will help media folks big time)
- Ability to do keyword search",1
Nice app just I want dark mode option data saver option and once time threads edit option,0
Amazing...💥,2
Nothing special just copied some features from Twitter. It would be better If Zuck also copy hashtag and trending feature from Twitter. I am disappointed because of this🤬,0

This app is very useful. I suggest you all must use this app 💝😘,2
5 Stars Rating but ....tw 😂,2
This application is really good and might beat Twitter soon.,2
Just doesn't work.. I see posts but no replies instead it only says something went wrong.. And can't post anything only said post failed to upload. As it is now it's useless and I would hate going back to twitter.. I tried every suggested fix that can be found on the Web.. Nothing works..,0

"It's okay. But I hope it has an option to simply switch account. Just like in IG where I can just double tap the profile icon then it switches. In threads, I need to logout first then switch account which is quite frustrating.",1

It was working fine then all of a sudden logged out and logged me out of Instagram. I was able to log back in to Instagram but not Threads. Trying to reinstall but now it's not installing. (?) Update: Was able to reinstall. I don't know what happened. Maybe a possible hack? Good thing I have some safety precautions in place.,1

Amazing,2
It looks like a cheap version of Twitter.,0
*successfully copied twitter* With more personal data expose and more often ads coming soon...just like any other meta app. I still dont get why would they even require such sensitive info...not even gonna use anyway for personalized threads... it's just to sell it for ad companies and make money Traaashhh...,0

So far so great! Just deleted the bird after 14 years.,2

"■ Connect with friends ■ Control the conversation — Until there will be an option for the FRIENDS ONLY feed, my review will be left with 1 star",0
Nice 👍,2
Easy to use,2
Great app and very simplistic,2
I never see anyone I’m followings posts. Atleast with Twitter they have the “following” tab now. Terrible knockoff.,0
Why does this need access to every single thing there is,0
Completely worthless without a chronological feed.,0
Nice 👍,2
"It's a really great app. But there has been a problem,sometimes when i follow people it automatically unfollows them. 😥😥",0
Love love the app already. But could you please put an option where we can choose a picture or videos according to their folders. it so hard when I scroll through the gallery from the app looking for a photo I want to post. Thankyou,1

This is not a paid review by Elon Musk.,0
"Don't know how to say about this application. Similar to ""The Blue Bird""🤣🤣🤣🤣 but the difference that I found is No direct message and No Hashtag. No direct message is more new approach like whatever you do you says, goes public (but for private accounts goes to your friends and followers) BUT no Hashtag to search the topic we need. That's make me don't know of how to use this application anymore. (Keep it don't delete it people say it could affect Instagram's account. 🤣🤣🤣",1
Need to improve interface,1
"Reposted a post and when they deleted it, the post went to “Content not available”. The post should've disappeared and not left a mark! It's making my profile look ugly. It's irritating.",0
Love,2
It would make it a lot easier if we were able to save things we like. And also edit our posts or threads as you would say. Because we are not able to alter it do you have to make sure it’s right on.,1
This is a nice app,2
It seems that it can replace Twitter !,2
Intresting,2
Bats,2
I think it'll be better if another update for threadsapp would enable you share a video posted on threads to Instagram story while it's playing and not a static pic of the video as it is now,1

The feed algorithm is hell on earth. No features. Pointless and will die in a few months. Was really hoping it would be good and save us from Elon,0
Good app,2
Steals way too much data it doesn't need and is just a breeding ground for unhinged liberals to brainwash kids,0
Number one thing I just noticed is the video player has NO scroll bar. I can’t go forward or backwards. Another thing this app needs is some sort of what’s trending page.,1
"Liking the concept so far, could be fun. Only thing I wish for is being able to scroll through just the people I'm following, separate thread. Also, when clicking on ""follow all on Instagram"", needs to be an acknowledgement that it works. Seems like my pending list should be a lot larger.",1

"Definitely an improvement over Twitter. Unfortunately there's no way to filter the ""threads"" by time. One post from 12 hours ago was right next to a post from 3 minutes ago right next to a post from 7 hours ago. A little too annoying to be useful at this present time.",1

Am the first to write a review on Mark Zuckerberg new app..wowee I had early access to it in the last few day and I think its great. When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish...r u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractive,1
Please introduce data saving. This app uses way too much data just for tweets. I don't need videos to load or high quality images,1
"I am loving the new platform, but there is something essential missing for global communities - translation options!

On that other app (you know what I’m talking about), there is a built in translate feature, and i am also able to use apple’s translate feature because i can select text and choose “translate”.

This is going to be essential for quick conversions.

Thanks, loving it so far!",1

However, with Twitter getting clunkier and progressively less usable since Musk took it over it seems that threads has the upper hand",1
The real reason why people are quitting Threads because it is literally boring. We have nothing to do on threads rather we prefer using Instagram.,1

"Hi Meta, I really like how simple and intuitive the UI is for this app. Though, I think this app desperately needs a “trending page” where you can see any big events or news at a glance like how you can on twitter. This would definitely help drive more people away from twitter and onto your platform.",2
New good apps,2
"I like that it doesn't show like count but number of replies. Social Media is about community, not popularity. Good job Instagram and Meta!",2

I’m not sure about this app but I will give it a try, I’m just gonna create new Instagram account just in case…",1
This is worthless to install app everything is same like insta with some little add one and if you want to delete your thread account u need to delete your instagram too that means these capatalist are forcing u to not uninstall ur account and I can see some privacy data leakage in this app worst app just a big giant company trying to supress the peoples with its capitalist powers,0

Things I don’t like is seeing people I follow respond to other threads. That should be a feature one can turn off.  I just want a clean timeline of threads I follow. Also I think there should be an option to search for threads easily. For example, I would like to search threads on puppies. Right now I don’t really see an option like that.",2

The app has absolutely no benefits over Twitter. It's a poor and desperate attempt to copy Twitter. Just another copy which is so typical for this company. Horrible app.,0

It's been very smooth. I really love this app..... We need the tending topics and Spaces functionality added to it. Thank you.,1
It’s like Twitter but no pics or videos and anti free speech why wouldn’t you just write what you have to say with a picture on instagram anyway or post on Facebook both are the same exact concepts,0

This app heg me...😠🤬,1
So much better than Tw*tter. So much less toxic and so much safer. You can be yourself on there and not have to worry about toxic people or the ruler E*on M*sk. It's so much better. I would recommend this app to everyone! It's THE best social media app we've had in YEARS!,2
God where are all these negative reviews coming from? The app is not even 3 days old. It's not going to have exactly what everyone wants. I think improvements and features will get better over time..The reviews where people are saying they can't sign up or it's difficult especially when they already have Instagram is laughable to me. It took me 1 minute..,2
The application is already good but to see photos or videos that are posted/liked is still difficult. Hopefully later it can be given the feature...,0

To be fair why don't you allow login using either of Meta accounts be it Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram. I feel like it's discriminative to non Instagram users.",0
Limited app,1
Lack of accessibility options. Lack of clear search filters. Lot of accounts I don't follow in the feed. Not clear how it works or decides what to show who but I see almost 0 from people I follow and almost 100% of everything I don't follow. It's great as a Twitter alternative and even better than Twitter but it could use a bit of clarity to figure out how to connect with other interests and accounts. Needs some kind of explore feature or hashtag search feature.,1

"so yea, the app was amazing cuz its exactly the same like Twitter and its obviously benefit us cuz we don’t have to create another account for this apps cuz we can just use Instagram, just the serious major problems that everyone may faced the same things as me, the apps seriously take up too much space, like compare to Twitter the, the megabytes is too small and the programmed works really well-the lossless compression really work for twitter, and another things that i would want to pointed out is that since the storage is limit for certain peoples and deleting the apps seriously devastating them cuz their account is getting deleted at the same time, its really devastating and upsetting me, i wish that by deleting the apps don’t cause their instagram account getting deleted, but overall im really enjoying the thread apps",1

It would be better as part of the instagram app, such as reels, as a section inside there.",0

"I am extremely disappointed with the functionality of the Threads app. Despite multiple attempts, including logging out and logging back in, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the app, I have been unable to upload new posts on my phone. It is incredibly frustrating to encounter such a basic issue that prevents me from sharing my experiences and engaging with others. In today’s fast-paced world, where seamless communication is essential, it is unacceptable for an app to fail at its core function. I sincerely hope that the developers address this problem promptly and enhance the app’s reliability and performance to ensure a smoother user experience.",0

"I didn’t realize you couldn’t delete without deleting your instagram. Not cool. I would like it if it wasn’t just a bunch of influencers in my feed. Same with the other app. I follow people I want to see. I don’t need to see ONLY influencers. I don’t mind a few sprinkled in (I do enjoy their content), but it’s all that I see. I have real friends I follow on there and they are nowhere to be found. I deleted Twitter long ago, so I probably should’ve realized it would be the same to me. It’s just annoying seeing all the same influencers sharing their same content on every app. I miss seeing people I want to interact with. Most of them don’t even interact with us peasants…",1

At this point I have muted and blocked more Threads accounts than I have followed. There’s no way to chronologically organize my timeline and only see threads from accounts I follow. It’s a hot mess right now and I cannot recommend downloading the Threads app.,0

Very good app. I surprised to see a nice app to ditch Twitter. I hope Threads have feature to save picture like Twitter. Since personally i using save picture many times in Twitter. Hopefully dev will add that feature. And if can it will better if we can change region (not language) so i can get better recommended in for another country. Plus we need history to look what post we like before.,2

"Threads seems pretty tight lipped about what they are doing in the background. Updates are just ‘bug fixes and performance enhancements’ which seems a little off for a brand new app. If you do some digging you can maybe find a blog post telling you what is new, but no clue how to change anything as the settings are nonexistent. I’m stepping away from the app for a while until the team figures out where they are going with it and when they become more transparent I may return.",0

"Over all, the UI of this app is good. Using it is easy and visually it is very clean. Unfortunately, it fails in the functionality department. My home feed is 99% random people and not the accounts I actually follow which defeats the purpose of following someone in the first place. I recommend having the home feed be just the posts from people I follow and a separate discover/search page that will show new accounts who post similar content to those I follow.",0

"Pointless in following anyone. The feed algo won't show you the content you actually follow and want to see. I find myself opening this app wanting to like it but quickly get annoyed by seeing randomness. It's like you're invited to a party all your friends are at. Then you get there and it's nothing but strangers all trying to have incoherent, disjointed conversations with you at the same time. It's more stressful and annoying than engaging.",0

So if you don't like free speech, can't handle someone else's opinion or just make everything about yourself, you'll love this app. For myself, though, I like hearing opinions, having debates, and not seeing a one-sided narrative of society.

Twitter used to say that there is not another option after him. And onetime Twitter didn't recover my account and saying that you already have an another account so we didn't recover your account too. It will be Twitter killer app,2
"This is definitely an early tech demo/alpha release. Lots of core functionality missing, like a web UI, native iPad layout, chronological timeline, ability to mute words, DMs, etc. I will check it out again once they get a feature-complete v1 released, but seems like it will be a bit before that happens",0

"There’s a lot to like with Threads, but one glaring omission that I noticed immediately is the inability to search for anything other than users.
I hope they are planning to drastically improve the search function so users can search words, phrases, hashtags — as well as for other users.

This will be THE determining factor for which app I use more, Threads or Twitter, and I’m pretty sure that I’m far from alone in that sentiment.

Very promising, but a few key tweaks are needed.",1

"This is what Facebook always wanted to be. You have absolutely no control over your feed. You have no say in whose content appears in it. You can’t sort it chronologically. So if you follow an account, their content is thrown haphazardly and in random order into the shuffle, to fight it out in the cacophony of content you never expressed interest in that is nevertheless demanding your attention. It’s staggering that Meta is still this shameless after being called out for deliberately making their media addictive and destructive.",0

"For a brand new app, it's very well optimized. However it's just missing quite a few features that apps like Twitter have. There is no way to have your timeline show threads from who you're following. It would also be nice to be able to switch accounts quickly like on Insta. I've also noticed that videos have a hard time playing audio sometimes. Overall, it's a decent first version that I hope will get more features as time goes on. I'll up my rating once the things I mentioned are addressed.",1

Videos play no sound and when you click the unmute button the video just gets stuck. Very irritating bug,1
Save yourself the uninstall and just don't download it.,0
Twitter Copycat.,0
Awesome start,2
"I want to read stuff only from people I follow, not some random bs from random strangers.",0
The app itself it's awesome..but need improvement a little bit.. more features must be included also!,2
This is just a simplified Facebook. Nothing else. No chronological order sorting and no way to filter only those who you follow. I'll just stick to Twitter until y'all decide to give users what you want.,0
Another Zuckerberg censorship device,0
Soo dark. Also it's like an unlimited message just bombed on ur screen,0
Why am I seeing post from people that I don't follow in Threads?,0
Far from perfect. Still seeing a few bugs and many features missing such as hashtags and account switching. Main feed is full of garbage from people I don't follow. Still better than Twitter though.,1
There is a glitch can't see full screen there isn't option to send screenshot so i would have sent it to show you guys.,0
"this may be a bug. 
i just downloaded the app an hour ago, posted one text status. now every time i refresh the app to make a post it closes the app entirely, it's whenever i press the button to make a new post at the bottom of the screen",2

Nothing special 💤,1
Login / registration fails. 2FA Codes are never sent via email or sms. I tried for 40 minutes. Dreadful first run experience.,0
This app is really mean to me as I found my role models here and they are posting mesmerizing content 🤍. Thank you 🙏,2
Its not famous so its an good opportunity to grow famous,2
🛜,2
"excellent app,i hope this doesnt like twitter",2
Bye bye Twitter say helo to threads,2
"Threads is the most “social” social media has felt in a while. There’s no fluff, just pure, unadulterated vibes! The simplicity and straightforwardness is the most exciting thing about this app. I dread the day ads and DMs are implemented, and pray that they won’t be. But a few things that should be implemented: an edit function, the ability to pin posts, the ability to switch between a public feed and a feed limited to the people you follow.",2
Very good app for social worker 👍,2
Look better than Tweet.,2
Better than Twitter,2
Millions of bugs. It doesn’t show me my posts or other people’s profiles!,0
Since I installed this app my Instagram account is not working properly,0
Goood,2
Feels so good to be on Threads!,2
Wonderful,2
Cool,2
"It’s pretty good overall, love the simplicity.  I enjoy that there are no reels or stories.  I do wish that my “feed” didn’t have random people I don’t know.  I want to see activity of only those I follow.  There should be a separate page of “recommended people” to follow.  The other thing would be to make it easy to switch accounts if you have multiple accounts, like a personal and business account.  Lastly, add Business Suite integration.",1
"I've tried multiple times to log in by using my Instagram info, and it keeps stating that he info is incorrect. It isnt worth any more of my time. ,🤷",0

The app is great but be allowed to talk freely here like it is in Twitter.,1
Good concept and I liked it when it worked but it stopped working for some reason. Every time I try to click on a thread it says content not available. Same with clicking on a profile.,0
So far so Good 😊,2
Let's try more time wasting app,1

💝💝💝,2
Threads is a great app. But it still has to improve a lot. The first problem I had to face is that the profile photo doesn't open by clicking on it. The second problem is that the sound of the video is muted and the volume button does not produce sound.,1

Please contact opinion add masage,0
Awesome,2
Better than Twitter for sure :),2
"This platform is an undercooked turd. Literally everything you hate about Instagram is distilled down into something even more annoying. This is a content graveyard. It is where posts go to die. I even offered to give away $1000 if I could get to 50 followers in 3 days, and got ZERO engagement. Don't waste your time with this garbage. At least on Twitter, it feels like you're talking to somebody... Twitter is bad because of the people. Threads is bad because it's a bad platform.",0
Amazing 💝😇🤩,2
"Why we should have this app in my phone with the same functionality of twitter, should not accept it by appstore because of there privacy policy",0
overall good but crashes on honor phones if you try to @ someone directly.. edit: app keeps crashing seemingly randomly not just when you try @ing someone,1
trash,0
Kinda useless without a chronological feed with only the people I follow,0
quite good,1

"Last night I downloaded the app, and my feed was full of my friends and things my friends had commented on, it felt really nice and authentic.

Today, I haven't seen a single post from my friends, instead the feed is entirely people I don't know and don't follow. I refreshed the page and decided to scroll and count how many stranger posts I'd see before I saw my friends posts, I decided to stop counting at 100. 

What's the point in following my friends on here if you're not gonna show me what they're posting? I'll be deleting the app until it's fixed.",0

"Dear Mark Zuckerberg, I don't know why u created threads, where is the creativity that u have done, and all what u do u stole the content of Twitter.",0
This isn’t a standalone product. You have to make an instagram account to use it. It’s only meant to be a way to increase new accounts for IG. Services that can only be accessed via linked social media accounts are scary and should be avoided for their datamining alone.,0

Meh.... it's ok for now. It's still new anyway. Looking forward to see it be improved,1

"I wish there was an option to only see threads from people you follow (Right now it's like the ""For You"" page on Twitter when it needs the ""Following"" option), and the ability to sort chronologically! If those two things changed, this would absolutely be a 5* app&beat Twitter by a mile. Right now, it's pretty ""meh"". Lots of room for improvement though!",0
💫,2
I'd like it more if it would stop booting me out every time I try to reply to anyone. What makes it worse is when I open it up again I can't find the thread I was replying to. It would also be good if it was easier to use gifs and search for topics you're interested in.,0
Love it,2

It really mess me up. I can't have a private with my friends. More mess😫",1
"Twitter was purposefully disconnected from your real identity. It was anonymous yet not. A way to get into the mind of everyone you knew. Instagram is LinkedIn for photos, and this app is designed to be used in the same way. There’s no NSFW content which immediately excludes SW’s and queer folk, which are part of the essential user base of twitter. Queer people are further prevented from getting involved with this app as it’s tied to your instagram and you can’t switch accounts. Finstas exist for a reason.",0

"Similar to Twitter, but 1- No option to create new account (just connect with insta) 👎 2- Cannot delete threads account without deleting Insta Account. 👎 3- No Hashtags 👎 4- No trending Stories 👎 5- No Chat /Personal Messages section 👎 Simply going to uninstall threads. Bye bye 👋",0

Love it so far but it needs improvement. It really needs hashtags. And I hate that celebs and business' are what you mainly see. I wanna see the smaller people. I want to be able to find artist. And I want a way to share my post to people who would be interested in it rather than hopeing a stranger likes it. The algorithm is working but it could use improvement.,1

Am still adjusting but however I do love it! I’ve noticed I been not checking my Twitter lately due to Threads🤷🏾‍♀️😆🫶🏾…overall this app is 5 ⭐️’s wish I could give 10 not limits whatsoever like Twitter recently jst did. Zuckerberg did his thang on this one n am 💯💯💯 standing w him!,2
Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvement but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me 😁,2

"3 stars so far since I want to request to add some features present in Instagram like sending DMs, and having GIFs to post. Moreover, please have a language translation function also, so a lot of people can connect with each other.

Hoping you make some updates so I can give this one a better review later, but for how it is now I most likely won't end up using it.",0
Great to use it.,2

"This app is very great since you can share your thoughts or whatever you want to share with it however, I'm experiencing some kind of error while using the apps like "" haven't posted any threads "" even tho I have already.

The entire feed is people you don’t follow. Even after I changed settings to “people you follow” it’s still horrible annoying posts. Get on and immediately got girls with no clothes etc. don’t join.,0

"It's engaging and interactive. Since the app is still in its development phase, I won't comment on that. However, I wonder if there is any chance that our Instagram and Threads account could be independent of each other in future. Lots (like me) might have two different accounts on Instagram - maybe one for pictures, another being content specific (poetry, photography etc). But for Threads I would any day prefer just a single account in my name.",1

"so i love the idea of threads. it’s a cool form of self expression especially since twitter became a ghost town (no one uses it anymore). but some things are already annoying me. firstly, having random verified people on my feed and i don’t care about them. i think we should have an option to see public thoughts and separate our followers. kinda like how ig has a favorite section on posting. secondly, i think it would be so cool if threads were built into the actual instagram app. similar to reels, we could also make threads a part of our profile. it could be a separate section like reels have that people can see our thoughts and get to know how we think. i think having a separate app is kinda extra. i love it but not a lot of people are actually interested in downloading another app, where as on the actual ig, like the new notes feature, people would engage more. other than that, i love this new addition!",1

If this is linked to Instagram and run by Meta we don’t need another app. It should be all in one.,0
"Although in its early stages, the use of the instagram profile to “build” a profile is easy, just does a poor job pulling similar content. Spent the first 20 minutes of use the ting to clear all of the “blue checks” of profiles that I don’t follow on instagram. Then reopen the app and finding the same challenge. 

Would rather have control to chose what content I want and not have suggested content placed in my “thread.” 

Only had this a few day, but deactivated my account and deleted it. Was not overall impressed.",0
"Decided to have a look, but you need an Instagram account. I don't have one.",0
Tried to register but it won't let me. Ended up having to uninstall it. Waste of time.,0
"i think the threads shows some real promise here. there are some very questionable moves on meta’s part such as 1. needing an insta account to have a threads account (having a separate but syncable account system similar to the instagram-facebook system would work much better and be much more attractive to current twitter users) and 2. deleting your threads account deletes your insta account. this second one in particular just comes off as meta not being confident in its own product. you really need to leverage my instagram account against me to keep my threads account? it’s just sketchy and moving twitter users over to threads will be very hard if this is the case. the other thing this will do is just inflate instagram’s numbers (not to mention overcrowd insta handles and make future insta users not want to join) because people will create burner instagram accounts just for threads. i also strongly recommend adding something similar to the “trending” page or the ability to search for anything other than people’s accounts. this just doesn’t make sense even from meta’s data-broker business model perspective. people currently use twitter and insta very differently, and if the goal is to compete with twitter then you have to have a system that will allow people to use threads similarly to how they would use twitter. this just gives meta more user data to build their platform on because it will give them insight on how people use twitter. what i also wanna say is that meta needs to add either a centralized or separate disable button for collecting data from users’ phones/other apps. the way it seems right now you can only turn it off for facebook, and this will turn people off because it makes people wonder “well does it also turn it off for insta and threads or is that separate?” meta has already implanted the sort of meta hub in the instagram settings to control all of one’s meta accounts. make it clear that disabling meta from accessing data from the parts of my phone that aren’t meta apps disables it for ALL meta apps and services. this will build trust with the community. overall, threads is a great idea. meta is probably the only company that can outcompete twitter, but it needs to adjust itself in a way that is welcome to twitter users in order to do so.",1

"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface.",2

"Loads of improvements can happen. Picture attachments have only ""Gallery"" and do not support folders. I have a load of trash on my Home feed from random users I don't follow. Needs a followers/for you separation in that case. Also, dark mode.",1
"I kept on hearing about this app, so I finally gave it a try. I’m not sure what it is, but something about it feels fake, as in too nice, too forced, too polite, too many rules. I like the raw style of Twitter much better, you’re free to express yourself without so many restrictions. I also don’t see much action going on, maybe because the app is too new. Personally, I don’t see a point to use it when I already have Twitter and Instagram. I can see how it can appeal to some people, because you get more of the fake celebrities on here than you do on Twitter, which are usually the most popular, but to each their own. I’ll be deleting the app, since I hear that if I close the account, I also lose my Instagram account, which I’ve had for years. What a terrible decision to link both apps that way.",0

This app wastes about 2/3 of a iPad’s screen space.,1
I still can'r connect,1

"Hello, Everything is excellent but I'm unable to find Trending page",1
This is very basic app yet... Not performing so well. Not expecting from a jiant company to produce this dull app.,0
I can't see anyone I follow. The page is a ton of random posts with the people you follow mixed in. No way to actually see friends posts and see exclusively who you actually WANT to see.,0
Guys stop moaning it's new app it will improve soon . I couldn't stand twitter 🤣,2

"It's alright but the scroll behaviour pisses me off. Stop restricting the scroll speed, it makes the app so annoying to scroll down and makes me leave faster.",1
There are way too many random people on my timeline. The algorithm is terrible because they don't even appear on my Instagram. They are not related to anything I interact with. I'd prefer it if the default tab were to be for mutuals only.,0

Let me check first how it works.,1
Not even close to compare to Twitter. It's an Instagram with a different layout. Same strict rules and awkward format. Impossible to search for posts rather than people. It may be a good alternative to Instagram but not to Twitter.,0

🥶😅,2
"Pleasantly surprised, I actually am enjoying it. Gave up on Twitter a while back and seems like this is an easy to use alternative. Not perfect, but it's brand new so I expect that. Give it a try (and delete twitter!)",2
it will be much comfortable to use if it has a feature where we can delete our thread acc independently without harming our IG accs. I just noticed that a lot of IG users are afraid to create Thread Accs because it could harm their IG acc once they wanted to take down their thread accounts,0
everything glitches when i scroll lmao,0
Facebook and Instagram had a baby that's call threads,2
Please add DMs/group chats and way to search up terms. Otherwise looks great.,2

This app harvests massive amounts of your personal data, including your exact home address, what you buy, where you go, who is in your contacts list, and even your personal HEALTH information.

There are safer non-profit social networking options out there, such as Mastodon, that don’t take your personal data and sell it to other companies (and governments!). 

Bravo to Apple for requiring app developers to disclose how much of our personal data these “free” apps are trying to collect!",0

Great App,2
It's ok but it's missing a lot of features and some of the things it has already is pretty buggy. I can't get videos to play with sound on. Either you watch with no sound or it freezes immediately.,0
The app has not been working for me for three days and i’ve tried everything and I also contacted the support team.,0
Just added one feature of tweet on Instagram app and made a new app Why should I use another app when I can get all the features on Instagram I think this should have been the feature upgrade on Instagram rather than new app,0

At the end of the day, both apps are terrible.",0
"Damn ! It's so simple to use , i feel this is a game changer ! Twitter is not bad but a little complex ! But here on threads it's supper simple ! Attractive look , beautiful experience out there !

"Hello, I am DPM DJ. I’d like to write a somewhat serious review on this app, so buckle in. First thing I notice when I go into the app is, “Hey. This looks a lot like Twitter. But…better?” Yes, it turns out that I have been enjoying this app more than Twitter and even Instagram to a certain extent due to the less toxic environment. Honestly, well done with that. This is the first time I’ve felt reasonably comfortable using a social media app. Second thing I notice…the absolute mess in my feed. Yes, I know that the app is fairly new, but my feed is looking kind of atrocious. Every time I refreshed my feed, hoping to see stuff from people I followed (which was probably around, if not over, 100 people) but was instead met with a crap ton of random people who had absolutely no affiliation with me or any of the people that I followed. That was kind of weird, but I decided not to mind that. Lastly, I decided to embrace the app’s less toxic environment, going around threads and seeing actual positive people and comments on each one. Long story short, this app is kind of like Twitter’s second chance or something, but made by a completely different social media company. Respect.",1

"Threads is an exceptional social media app. With its intuitive design, diverse features, vibrant community, and seamless integration, it stands out as a top choice for connecting and engaging with others. Highly recommended!",2
Great,2
"3 stars FOR NOW. its very obvious you guys rushed the release of this. Im gonna change this to 4 after you released: Media section in profile, Direct Messages, Following feed, Hashtags and the option to zoom in on images using two fingers.",1
Update.. Still sucks after updates today July 19th. Just put it in chronological order like Twitter does and everything will be perfect I don't want to see threats from people I don't follow Seems nice but what the hell all I see is people that I don't follow I go check off thread only people I follow and yet I still see Toys R Us in my timeline like why I just want to see who I follow in chronological order of the time they send a message have the people who created this and never use Twitter?,0
allow account switching and hashtags,1
Please remove photos and video sharing option from threads. Atleast video .Make it just for writing . I don't want to see REELS in threads also🫣🫣,1

An amazing experience to try threads . Add some more things than Twitter otherwise it's just a clone to Twitter but still it got Twitter run for money. Follow me to get follow back ( crypto_mein_kamao ),2

There!  The first 10 words of this review are exactly like the Threads app.  Your feed will feature all kinds of worthless and unwanted posts.  Don't want to see posts from people you don't follow?  Too bad, because that's what Threads does.  Just be glad I didn't put *all* the words in this review in a random order... Threads will do it to you with no way to read posts in chronological order in your feed.

If you have the sense of humor of a Hulu ad then this brand managers idea of a social media app is for you. Threads only exists for influencers and brands to talk at each other. You can't curate a feed so your generated on can be full of hate speech like mine was. Golly heck you can't even swear and explicit content is banned. You also need a separate account to sign up and you can't delete this profile without deleting your Instagram. Avoid.,0

I think it’s a really good option for people who are leaving Twitter or just to have a good second if Twitter goes under I think once you add a GIF library then it’s better then Twitter but it’s still a great app and perfect for people who are on Instagram but never was on Twitter.,1
Nice,2
"I'm just scrolling it and checking it, till know it looks good.",2
"There are no settings for you to control the experience. 

I made the mistake of refreshing my homepage and now I’m seeing accounts from the entire world — I can’t even find the people I follow anymore. And like I said, there are no settings options to fix this??

There’s no easy way to switch accounts. I signed in with one insta account, but now don’t get to sign in with my other accounts?

Am I only allowed to create an account through Instagram? The one thing I liked about Twitter is I had an account where my family wouldnt find me. I’d like to be able to carry that experience over on a new platform.",0
Very good threads aap,2
The great one 💪😍🔥🔥,2

Good app,1
Best app,2
"Just feels like a really bad clone of twitter with less features. Biggest killer is the lack of a web version. Deleted in less than an hour of downloading it. Even with twitter on the downfall with Elon's dumb decisions, its still wayyy better than what this is.",0
This app is good,0
Nice app,2
Twitter better,0
"I am giving it 1 star not because the app is bad or not a good ui i am giving it 1 star because it crashes every single time i click on comment button on anyone’s post 
Also for information i am using iphone 8 
So i request the company to make some bugs clear plus performance improvements also make it compatible so everybody can use this brilliant app like me",0
Idk man. It just seems like a total rip off of twitter. I don’t get what the point of it is. What part of this app is better than others? Idk maybe I just don’t get it.,0
Nice app 👌🏻,2
I’ll give this app a 5 star review if I get the option to make a separate account on there instead of making another on instagram,1

I love this for Trapdoor San Diego!,2
"Nice but still has a bit of a long way to go,needs to have a separate followings timeline, and to stop importing people from Instagram",1
Mejor Twitter pero ni tan mal,1
The app is very buggy and the UI elements overlap on one another when scrolled.,0
"You’d think with all of the data they collect that the algorithm would at least be good, like TikTok. Zuck yet again fails to understand that users need to get something out of social media too. I don’t want to see ads and verified accounts. The algorithm needs heavy improvement. 

As a side note, how is this supposed to replace twitter without corn??",0
"App is good all perfect but i really appreciate if you guys.. threads team add a group chat,private message,profile banner,content selection and voice",2

Nice app 👍,2
"Le falta las opción para poder eliminar las publicaciones en el muro de uno de personas a las cuales no sigues, es irritante ver tanta persona con ideales tan diferentes, además, que se tengan las.mismas opciones de configuración de IG impide poder bloquear a una persona solo de threads, que es lo que necesito, deberían de tener un backend aparte. A pesar de la limitación, sigo prefiriendo Twitter",0
Unproductive 🙃,1
"What I don’t like about Threads is you don’t get a full screen on iPad, like Twitter.",0
This is very good,2

Nice,2
It's pretty cool . One of the best social media apps,2
Elon vs marky hogya😂,2
Worse than twitter,0
🎗️🌹😍.....💓,2
"not a bad app, just wishing that there were more features that would make it easier to navigate and categorize the app but i like the simplicity of the app as it is now. also making accounts independent from instagram and adding pinned threads/bookmarks to save threads. it would also be cool if you guys added a way to look at all the posts you've liked. also there's a glitch where whenever i try to open a thread it'll crash and close the app. don't know what that's about???",1
"You cannot delete your threads account without also deleting your Instagram account and they require you to fork over intrusive amounts of personal data, until this greviois oversight is fixed, stick to twitter or twitter alternatives",0

Time waste App crash on every open,0
wish you will add the feature of double tapping the icon on lower corner to switch accounts just like on IG,1
You can only use this app if you already have Instagram which I don't so can't use,0

Forces you to use Instagram,0
"So far, this is an instant upgrade over Twitter. There are still some things I think could improve it (like the ability to edit posts), but overall, I dig it. Honestly, just go ahead and integrate all of IG's features into Threads, and you have an instant Twitter killer.",1
Nice 🙂🙂🙂🙂,2
Wanna be twitter. Trying too hard to be both,0
1year,2
"This app is great - very user friendly, simple, fun to use and post things. Personally, I think it should incorporate more things from instagram 1) so it can further distinguish itself from that *one* social media platform
and
2) it can be a more complex, yet, again, simple to understand interface
Some things I’m talking about is maybe a “drafts” option, maybe another version of “close friends” where only a select few can view your post. Just things like that, but overall, amazing app!",1
Useless,0
"Pointless. It's a Twitter lite without any of the fun. Heavy handed moderation and no searches or hashtags. It lacks any useful features and the content will be gone soon if they don't quickly release features and lighten up on their policies. I'll probably uninstall it in a week, not worth the extra battery drain and Facebook tracking in its current state.",0
Good 👍😊,2
"I love this thread app, Instagram♥️♥️",1
Easy to use,2
Is easier than Twitter to use!,2

"I absolutely loving my time in here. However, there needs to be a dedicated feed for people you follow and not just random people mixed in with followed. And for the mixed feed, it needs to be based on your interests. Right now the posts mixed in your feed are from completely random people with no rhyme or reason. Even people speaking different languages. A huge flaw in this app. It also needs a proper, fully functioning website.",1
Super,2
Needs more edit settings and cleaner ui along with easier posting all and all i like the algorithm keep it like that,1
The initial impression is good,1
"Better than twitter. Free from the absolute mess that it's become. Do you remember having issues with Facebook or Instagram? Me neither. I expect none to arrive with Threads either. Twitter however is currently unusable. Full of bots, spam and right wing conspiracy nutjobs.",2

Good 👍,1
"I only give this app a four-star review because it needs a translator. Other than that, it’s great.",0
One for copying,0
Better app from Twitter 😂😂,2
"So far I enjoy the simplicity of the app, which I understand most apps start off this way but I urge the developers to not start adding unnecessary features that make it feel and look like what Facebook, Instagram and Twitter has become. There are ads everywhere, there’s content I just do not care to see which causes me to miss the content of the people I actually follow. Also never Get rid of the free form writing features; tab or return button allowing us to create space between paragraphs, as well as the capability to write longer paragraphs. Simple and clean is the way to go in my opinion, I love to write and I love to read. I don’t mind a few videos or pictures here and there but I believe the main focus on threads should more text based content.",1
"I was looking forward to having a Twitter substitute for news and opinion. Sadly, Meta has explicitly stated this is not its goal. Moreover, it seems their algorithm is based on both your IG and Threads account. I follow pop culture on IG and wanted to use threads for news. But my entire Threads timeline seems to be recommendations based on my IG follows, not my Threads follows. My interest in the app is basically dead until reporters start using it and Meta is able to identify what a person wants to see on Threads specifically.",0
"It needs a lot of improvements , however, for now, it is a great app .",1
"Twitter rehash I guess? Never felt strongly for twt so idc about that. Seems okay so far, I think it's been like 3 days since launch. Biggest complaint: I only want to see posts from people I actually follow... preferably without having to mute a million people thanks",1

Byeeeee Twitter 👍🏽😹😭,2
Threads is the best new social media app I've used since 2012. It definitely is not finished features are bare bones however it is a soild platform. I would recommend it. However it does not have messages or friends list or even a dark mode. Other than Facebook or Twitter it stands out!,1
Tell your friend to do the same! It’s Win-Win…not really but better than nothing.,2

"Ok I have an account, I’m following my friends, they’re posting, but I can only see verified accounts.",0
Instagram his op,2
As of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.,0

Hi 👋 I'm here dear zunk,2
I deactivated my account because I can't open my ig 😭,0
Good but had a bug it wouldnt let me add photo so had to reinstall,2
Mere ko yahan per Bluetooth chahie please 🥺,2
Quite basic. I think Twitter is way better.,0
"Writing after day 1, it's about as smooth a launch as it could've hoped for. I am however having a problem where if I search for users too much (as one looking for accounts to follow will do), the search breaks and doesn't fix itself. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a rate limit. It fixed after reinstallation but only once. I hope and expect more features will be added to the app in short order, too. E.g. DMs, customized account lists, Web version. Default home feed should be different.",2
Stop showing me people whom I don't follow on my home page. Move that to a separate explore page or something.,0
You can't delete Threads without deleting your entire instagram account. Gross. So I'm deleting both! Byeee!,0
I just installed it to give one star.,0
Nice app,1

"The UI is very broken, I can't even scroll without stuff completely breaking. Can't even describe.",0
It’s just the beginning of a brand new apps with loads of users from IG! So far I’m loving it because of minimalist design and ease of using. No ads so far. I hope if they start monetizing they will keep it in a sane way.,2
"A lot of potential, but it's still way too buggy. It's also way too sensitive on its auto-ban system. I'll follow 10 people, and then can't follow anyone else for at least 24 hours. Hoping Meta fixes all the issues soon so that I don't have to leave and come back later. Updating to say that they never respond in any way when you report an issue. 0 actual support.",0
Awesome,2
Good,2
Instagram is going to the next level.,1
Very basic and it takes way to much of your info. You also must use an Instagram account and once you link it you can't delete it without deleting your Instagram account.,0
The app has a bug,0
At least display Name followed by username like Twitter Ping on me incase its hard I help you,0
Threads not working in my device . Maybe a glitch or something I don't know. I have sent an email please have a look,0

"When I log in to instagram, the threads log out. Vice versa. Because of this, my instagram was violated and I couldn't interact with my friends.I can't even comment, like or follow.

Better than tweet,2
"This is so cool but would you likely be adding new features like an edit button to edit our posts and adding a multiple accounts thing so we can switch between accounts so easily?? That be awesome if you guys can, but other than that, this app is awesome!! A cool replacement for Twitter hehehe 

Keep being awesome and adding cool new features that we can use!!",2

"I like being able to have this option - I'm not necessarily opposed to it. But PLEASE... for the love of everything that is good in this world - bring back old Instagram!!! I know SO MANY people who would get back on Instagram if y'all focused on POSTS again & made a SEPARATE app for reels. If you can make a separate app for these functions, please also make a separate app for the other new features you had added. This would truly be mutually beneficial.",0

Wow nice app. Very easy to use I think I prefer this than Twitter.,2
Nice APK,2
Good,2
Excellent work 👍,2

"More features are requested, for sure, including the ability to filter posts (or threads, I should say), perhaps the ability to quickly switch between accounts (especially if you have more than one), and maybe the ability to send private messages (or rather, DMs), just to name a few.

But overall, it’s a nice, clean app, easy-to-use, and hopefully will live up to be the “killer app” that everyone is expecting it to be (you know, compared to that other one with the blue bird)!",2

"Good app so far!! I don’t use Twitter but since I’m joining this app right as it’s getting started I have time to figure this system out! It’s very clean and simple, which I enjoy. 

Please Meta, please add the switch accounts button so we don’t have to log out between accounts. It would be so much better!! Another feature that would be nice is filtered feed like in Instagram where you can switch between following and recommended. Thanks!",2

The lack of moderation right now and the timeline are my main complaints
Other than that I’m happy to finally stop using twitter.",1
Keeps crashing when commenting,0
"Purposely checked who I follow
On instagram and thread is loaded with a lot of accounts I do not follow. Not a fan unless they fix that",1
I don't see a point in this app. 1) I can't search for a specific post based on keywords. Or related topics 2) cannot know what is happening locally because there is no location based trends. 3) I don't understand the feed. It has nothing that I'm interested. I don't know why I'm asked to view those posts. 4) I cannot use the app to DM anybody.,0

"Not the Twitter replacement I hoped for.

"In its infancy of course, there are many tweaks that can, and will be done over the course of the next few months and even years however, right now minus a few things - the app is really quite incredible. 
Easy to learn, post, navigate, search. It is a testament to the hard work of a lot of creators and currently it is really a lot of fun. I’d recommend it to anybody looking for an active social platform where you can communicate with just about anybody.",2

Meta by linking Threads and Instagram have locked the two accounts together. You cannot delete a threads account with also deleting your Instagram account.

Very nice application,2
Best app,2
"Very simple, sweet, easy to use and everyone is nice. Could use some things to help organize it like a media tab or a ""following"" feed or maybe more ways to customize your profile like a banner but overall it's really nicely put together and honestly very approachable. 10/10 for a new app",2
"This app is awesome! At one point, society had an app that had a picture of a bird, a lot of angry people, and a lot of bots. Can't remember what it was called, cause on 7/5/23 everyone uninstalled it. This app is essential for any business owner, independent contractor or influencer. The new gold standard for thread based social media!",2
"This app is already amazing and smooth all you need to do it listen to feedback and you’ll kick Twitter off the planet, GO THREADS #### TWITTER",2

Weird app.,0
It keeps lagging,0
"App is stable and has most folks I follow at Twitter. It's missing few important features like desktop support, Search by keywords and trends. Hopefully those features are added soon",2
I might just stick to Twitter,0
Good app but more can be done,1
This app is great so much better than Twitter. I hope they delete Twitter so we can have Threads. Thank you for making this app Mark Zuckerberg thank you..,2
The app is full of glitch. Can't even scroll the feed section as it shows only some glitchy mess. I think the app does not support in every phones. The app is a complete glitch in my phone (Redmi Note 8).,0

I'm likely to delete the app unless my feed cleans up. It's sending lots of stuff I have no interest in and do not like.,0

Great,2
Game Changer,2
whenever i sign into either instagram or threads it will sign me out of my account on the other platform,0
"Seems to be working OK and I’m finding a few with my friends and I hope to make more. I would like to be able to have more functions like making the page larger on my iPad, and instantly having my totals add up instead of having to refresh the page, like close it out and open it up again, and refresh it that way, but these are early days I’m sure all these will be worked on in the future. As long as it destroys Twitter, I’m OK with that.",1

My early comment and this app will makes so many unemployed people life better and provide a source of income so. I reviewed for a great app,2
Just open and join the apps,1
Logged out to log into a different account and now I can't get in at all and the app crashes every time I open it to attempt to login.,0
"Lacking a lot of features and functionality, so the user experience is currently far inferior to Twitter. Really only useful to people who have a large following on Instagram, the growth potential for smaller accounts is virtually non existent. Nice clean UI tho",0
good than twitter,1
"Didn't know you had to have an Instagram account so I made one, then it locked my account out because it wanted my phone number. I shouldn't have to put my number to have an account so my account is locked because of it.",0
"I like it, so far I haven't got any issues and is a user-friendly app. I didn't have to create a new account. Everything was ported from Instagram. Im happy with it 😊",2
I will use it for healing hahahahahahaha,2
"It is glitchy as soon as i scroll my screen, the text leaves it's shadows and merges with the current screen",0
Feed packed with content i do not follow/want,1
"Happy to see it, it's will be new journey, thanks @insta. Now we can share our thoughts on it. 😍 😍",2
New beginning 😁,2
Nice app but just it doesn't upload some pics .....why does it have to select the pics?!,0
"I like the app though the DM feature is very welcome. Additionally, additionally, a home feed just for people you follow would be good ADD HASHTAGS! I'd recommend that you also find a way of showing us what's trending. With proper implementation of user feedback, twitter won't be the primary go to app. One more thing, avoid censorship!",2
Compition between Twitter and threads 😀😀😀 Elon between Mark,1
Threads feels 70% done. No #ALT No #Hashtag support No #Hashtag search No editing of posts No searching for people on the #Fediverse,0
Good,2
Its,2
I am giving this app 1 star coz i ain't Gay (Elon Musk Is King),0
"It's cool, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the ""Post"" button at the top of the posting menu. Also, there's a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but needs some polish. Also, kinda wish there was an option to make an account from scratch rather than import an Instagram account.",1
"Its a perfect glitch app, i tried to reinstall but same problem. Just when i scroll down it starts glitching!",0
Very bad App. Play Store please this app band very fast. This app is a trap App. Anyone don't trust this app🙏🏻🙏🏻😭😭,0

worst app I ever uesed...,0
"My dp is not showing on.. and there is no option to adjust,,, plz make it correct",1
Its a worst app ever when i started using for the first time the screen is full of white lines..,0
"Makes me sign up for an Instagram account, but doesn't give the option within the app. Then it tells me my IP address is an open proxy, tells me check their help, which has nothing about it. Like I'm jumping through hoops so they can steal all my data.",0

"I used this app however this is somewhat appears to be the clone of Twitter application but yeah even better in some ways from it. Likewise, it's UI is more user friendly and it's very smooth but features and not so much. So I request Instagram to please add more features and update this app on a interval basis. Then definitely this app will be the best also after crossing Twitter.",2

Threads destroyed my ability to post on Instagram. On Twitter some say they have the same problem. I can only post Stories. No photos. Instagram will not let me remove the Threads badge now. My Instagram worked until this. It’s been a full day! Save yourself the trouble and don’t use Threads.,0
Nice 🙂,2
"The best social media app! It feels so smooth! This is a combination of facebook and instagram, a lighter, smoother and no limitations!",2
Needs more features and stability,1
Better then Twitter,2
Nice experience,2
"Threads has been great so far! I deleted my account on that other app and I'm Threads solely. 

So refreshing to be away from that anger and hate.

Really looking forward to the future updates!",2
It won’t even let you login… fix the bugs???,0
App's ui is good and easy to use but i gave 4 star because of @ and # feature not available or not working???,1

Disappointing. People flood it with photos and videos anyway. I wish it was just text based. This isn't a text based social network. It's just another social network.,0
"Has the potential to replace Twitter but so far it's missing a lot of crucial features such as translation, top comments shown on top, trending page etc. I'd give it a 5/10",1
Threads is very useful app 🙏🥳,2
not as much as good as Twitter,0
Why doesn't it have a dark mode??? Needs a dark mode.,1

It kicked off on a good note. I hope they maintain the energy,1
Good :D,2
"The deal breaker for this app is the lack of ability to sort all the junk on the home screen to just what we want to see like people we follow. Without that feature, its juat random junk no one wants to read.",0
Still loading! i think the app crashing because of high volume of a new users,1
Good bait,1

Very Bad app,0

Good,2
Love it! Perfect perfect perfect,2
Nice app 👍,2
"When I get started making an account here, it was crashing and lagging but my phone was perfectly fine no any issues or any other problems. I guess this app needs more enhancement and fix to the issues.",0
"Good. But if follow several people at once, always showing restricted massages. That's nonsense",1
Coba dulu ygy 😁🤭,2
Casteist slurs are not flagged here either,0
It is a good app,1
"as the tittle says, pretty decent & has potential! but personally, as i’m sure others would agree too (i also know you’re still developing/tweaking) but i would love my home feed/timeline to consist of ONLY the people i follow. i’d like a separate explore tab with all the random ppl (the home page you currently have) would be nice! i would love to pick & choose when i get to see random people i don’t follow because my home page just feels like spam/junk mail with zero access to content i actually care about.  also, would love to see a, who i’m following tab as well. thanks!",1
Nice !,2
Copy of Twitter I think you forgot to add the space option 💀 But it's k for Insta Ki Public 🕊️🤺🤧 ( Jisko Twitter ka nhi pata ),0
It seems good 👍,2
"I am very much impressed by using the app, so I will tell you the same thing, you should also do it by downloading this app. 🙆",2
I have noticed as of Friday that once I click on the icon to write a thread I get kicked out of the app 🥴.  I have to uninstall at least once per day (so that it functions properly).,0
I hope Good,2
Excellent this app,2
Amazing social media,2
Threads are good with the Instagram account,2
"Can’t sign up to use this app, because Meat is dumb. Want to join threads, cool! Now, to download this second app we have, sign up on it, verify you information and THEN we will let you create an account on here…

Yeah, no, I’ll just wait for twitter to die.",0
"Even though Twitter is pretty decent nowadays, Threads is what I find much more useful than Twitter!

I officially joined the latest social media app and it’s super perfect to use!",2
Crash bug I griped about is gone already.,1
Great app.Can be a good competitor for twitter.,1
"it keeps bugging, i can't read post from my phone",0
This feels like a low grade Twitter currently. Mirroring some of the more mainstream features without truly contributing to a impactful experience. Still has some work to be done before being able to reach its true potential.,0
Reviewing it on first day of it's launch. Hope I'm not disappointed.,1
Its a new era app #Tweeterkiller,1
"I have major issues logging in, whenever I switch it Instagram I instantly get logged out saying that the user might have changed the password when the password remains the same. The same thing happens when I open the threads app. Has a lot of potential otherwise. The app continuously keeps crashing as well as Instagram",0
This over Twitter anyday!,2

Still didn't installed 😐😐,0
Here we are again next level,2
"it's a shame that you can't search topics and only rely on the algorithm of the feed, I expected more from Meta but I am deeply disappointed.",0
"An app itself feels like cheap twitter put into instagram skin. No support, no good features, random bans. Considering Facebook privacy policy you are giving away all your data including medical, personal, interests, shopping etc to Meta for free with no real benefits. I would rather go and use crappy Twitter.",0

Good luck with the launch ♥️ lots of love,2

Excellent,2

Can you add translation?,2
It's good but has a few kinks. It needs settings like an in-app dark mode instead of it being tied to my phones settings. Along with features like direct messaging. Ads don't seem too intrusive but I'd like to see more in my feed from people I follow,1
Good app 👍👍👍,2
"Hi there! Though the initial experience of finding my way through to Threads was exciting, I must say the drawback for me was that I can't add multiple accounts yet. Could you resolve that already please Threads Team?!",1
خوب عالی مثل همیشه,2
"the app was good and kinda quiet interesting than fb, but there's no edit option if you want to change something on your captions",1
"We can't delete our threads account, If we want to delete it needs to delete our Instagram account! Good job zuck",0
"Nice great conversation & chat app 👍😍. Perfect great solution for asking open conversations (all comments, all replies, and all chats), sharing recent photos & videos, adding like to the recent photos & videos, adding stickers & GIFs, and of course being close friend with all Instagram followers no matter what situations & events it is 😍😍. Great better, easier, faster, and securable app 👍😍.",2
"I wasnt getting notifications for my messages, I turned off this app and I started to get audio notifications...",0
Threads is trending on twitter HAHAHAAHAH,2
"It has a lot of potential, I feel that its missing a few features such as a following/suggestions option on the FYP. an easier setup for being able to see and read replys, I find it difficult to see the replys for a specific post. Another feature I would recommend is a like count on the account page.",1
good,1
"Full of bugs, followers count stuck, can't see others followers, can't see who's not following you, can't complete delete others mention on your thread, Instagram quick access disappeared...",0
It's just like Twitter 🙂,2
"Everything else is very convenient, but it's not easy to use without an interpreter.",1
"for an app that feels like it's in beta, it's decent enough. should be way more polished. I have found bugs in media uploading, already widely reported, but also in the titulary threads feature. sometimes duplicate posts show up if u delete something and repost it. other than that, it's a bit empty, needs voice clips, and a button to DM ppl",1
The content shows as not available and I can’t see any replies or info on my account,0
Nice,1
better than twit,2
Works well enough. It would benefit by creating a separate feed for the people I follow and another for the trending topics. Just my 2 cents.,1

"Trying out the app. It's very new at this time, so who knows. So far it seems alright, there's content, a lot of big names are already using it. I've never used Twitter, so I don't know how it compares. I will state here, I've heard rumors that Threads will be actively censoring nazi content, and I'm here for that. Looking forward to nazi-free social media experience",1

Needs a suggestions tab of “people you might know” if you didn’t click the follow all option in the beginning. tired of seeing random peoples posts. also wish the name option in your bio didn’t transfer over and you can put a different name on the threads app. Following tab for others? liked posts / #’s / trending searches / explore? But still make it stand out from twitter. Know that’s already on the instagram app but it’d be cool to have something different on threads to scroll through,1
"So far, it's pretty good. Just wish we could control what we see on our news feed. Noticing lots of people I'm not following.",1
Fine but need a lot more work. We need an option to see just the post of people we follow. Translation in the post. Hashtags. Be able to edit posts.,1

i think im the firt one here!,2
Absolutely better than twitter (Don’t deactivate my account elon 😂),2
Threads brings Meta’s moderation policies and invasive privacy practices to a cloned Twitter experience. It’s like declaring yourself #TeamZuck vs #TeamElon when you could opt for a better future where billionaires don’t own your social media presence with Mastodon.,0
"I can honestly say that the app is a nightmare. As an avid user who relies on platforms like this for news, updates, and connections, I am utterly disappointed.

The app's performance has hit an all-time low. It lags, freezes, and crashes constantly, making it nearly impossible to have a smooth browsing experience. It's as if the developers took a promising app and intentionally wrecked it.

And don't even get me started on the algorithm! The prioritization of irrelevant and repetitive content is mind-numbing. I followed accounts for a reason, but they are rarely shown, while suggestions that I have no interest in flood my feed. It's an infuriating waste of time.

The app also bombards users with endless ads and sponsored content, effectively killing the authenticity and charm of the platform. This invasive approach feels greedy and reflects a lack of respect for users' time and attention.

In conclusion, the app has become a breeding ground for frustration. Its glitches, algorithmic failures, lack of action against harassment, excessive ads, and poor UX have turned a once-promising platform into a colossal disappointment. Unless drastic improvements are made, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a worthwhile social media experience.",0
It's look like twitter,1

"It’s great that we’re able to follow all our instagram connections on threads with just one click but here is a bug: 

All the people that I already was following on instagram, received multiple back to back “follow requests” from me on instagram all over again, when I started using threads. 

Now my notifications tab is blowing up with multiple “your connection request has been accepted” notifications from Instagram!!! 

So much for “Threads, an instagram app”. Deleted my threads profile and uninstalled the app but the notification madness on instagram is still going on.",0

As titled.,2
Waste of time,0
I am having terrible glitches,0
Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phone,1

Very boring app,0
The app is useless and boring,0
"Platform runs well. The first day of launch the algorithm focused on only the newest Threads being shared first, then it started older threads on day 2 which killed the vibe. 

Beyond that the app requires way to much invasion of personal privacy and information that Meta takes and sells to companies to use to target their consumers. Literally all of the data collected on you personal devices which also includes browsing history, apps used, time spent on those apps, ethnicity, religion, political party, and so much more. 

There needs to be a limit to how much data these companies can collect.",0

It could use some features like gifs, maybe live stream etc. The tweets aren't repetitive as you scroll your feed, unlike Twitter, and it seems as though you can see everyone thread who posts on the platform, which is cool.

"99% of my feed is from people I’m not following. They force a lot of big celebrities and companies on us which I’m not a fan of.  There’s no news / trending section which they’ve already explained that they do not intend to add due to the nature of politics and news. They want to keep a positive vibe and they feel that those topics are too heated. Sure this makes it a more pleasant place but I do not believe people should be sheltered from the harsh realities of our world just to avoid arguments. 

There needs to be a dark mode. I have photosensitivity and looking and a bright white screen hurts my eyes. 

I was hopeful that this would replace Twitter because Elon Musk is horrible. Unfortunately the hollow Instagram illusion is what they’re set on maintaining and I do not feel it is right for this type of social media.",0

It's wonderful I like this 😍,2
Once I open the app shows overlapped content consistently Giving us a dizziness and irritation. 2. Unable to download the media like photos making it very difficult to use this if we want the media.,0

i give 1 star. this app is good but dont give the option to just see the Threads only from the people we follow ! why must i read from strangers ?? enough with the random strangers rant in our feed ! and there's no translation service. good thing is it filters out p0rn unlike shwitter.,0
Great 😃👍,2

"Needs a couple more features, such as bookmarks, being able to see quotes, etc. But overall a good substitute for twitter",1
"It would be nice if we had a ""For You"" and ""Following"" tab on the homepage. We could also make the scrolling animation smoother, like on Instagram, and add a trending page.",2

"I genuinely  believe this app will eat the rest, however, I heard so they don’t have plans in Direct Message feature and this would kill the app for me, besides that, I’d love to see another small feature where you can hide your Instagram profile since it’s private for me…",2

Great app. We can use this app easily,2
"I'm getting duplicate notifications, even though I have a public account I'm being asked to approve follow requests.",1
"It's basically facebook but your racist uncle hasn't shown up *yet*, brands are being vaguely and awkwardly horny, and that one friend who thinks they're an influencer because they sell oils for an mlm is doing whatever that is. The app works well though so I give it an extra star for that.",0
Good job mark 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻,2
"I want the option to post multiple threads as a carousel on instagram.

For example, if I have 10 or less threads all replying to each other I want to hit one button to post all of them as pictures onto instagram without posting each one individually (I could post each message individually on Twitter if I wanted to take the time.) I think that feature would be really cool on threads and encourage more engagement.

Maybe we could increase the carousel limit on ig too?",1
Liked till I saw those that have to put in zero effort to gain 4500 followers in a hour.  Should of been a fresh start on follower base. Only those with strong instagram profiles will benefit from engagement.,0
"Hello, I love Threads so far, though I have encountered a bug, I tried to reply with a comment on @Raspberry_Pi thread post, then upload a photo attachment, then threads crashes everytime. So I can't upload an image on a thread without my Thread app crashing on my Galaxy, help :)",1
This is honestly one of the best apps ever. I am glad this doesnt have adds. One suggestion i would like is that when a person you follow repots something- there should be an icon that will notify you instead of having to go to their profile. This is truly a nice app,2
If we have to delete only thread account then why we have to loose our insta account Its not making any sense People trust meta that's why the choose thread over Twitter So please dear team do something about it 🙏,0
"Good app, but still missing gallery/media tab on profiles then it'll be perfect",1
Won't let me create an account and no options to help with that,0
Very basic. Third rate Twitter knock off. Just get Twitter.,0
Too invasive! This isn't the 1st time #ThreadsApp has failed. It's been around since at least 2019 when it tried to rival #Snapchat & it failed miserably. #Zuckerberg is a joke who can't even come up w/his own original ideas. He just clones & steals others work! Can't wait till it fails again,0
Bad experience not working properly you have to work on interface really disappointed.,0
Very good app.. Superior ❤️,2
you people really need to add a permanently deleting option which doesn’t concern the Instagram account. ik It's a great marketing strategy and all but it’s getting annoying. when I thread stuff I don’t want people to know my actual Instagram account. that was literally the whole point of anitwt. ughhh It's getting annoying.,0
Joined easily,2
This is unofficial then twitter,0
Ok,2
Great app✅,2
"Seemed like a great new alternative at first, but it still has Instagram's garbage moderation and is constantly crashing on me. You open it up and see nudity, slurs, and threats immediately and the moderation team just goes ""nah its staying lol"" and that's it. Still better than the alternative, but not by much",1

Not perfect but could be great if they begin minor improvements like hashtags and more comprehensive search. Runs really smooth and UI is clean and simple. Hopefully it doesn't get too bloated and busy like Instagram. A lot better than the cess pool that is Twitter.,2

"i was excited to install this app as a user of mastodon, instagram, and just about every social media site under the sun these days. excitement turned into frustration really quickly. good on meta for using activitypub so you can follow anyone across the web and the fediverse. i was excited since i could see what my friends i know irl post since they mainly only use instagram and this entire site is based around instagram. it let me follow everyone i knew on instagram quickly, cool! it even told me about the fediverse integration coming up. then, the real fun began. the home feed was filled with absolutely nobody i follow (even after importing my follows and followers from instagram) and shows a lot of content that really shouldn’t be allowed on here. there’s basically no hashtag support, and the app is buggy. constant crashing, forced autoplay, algorithmic feed with basically no one you follow or any interests of yours. the fediverse integration isn’t even available at launch. it’s all verified accounts on the homepage and no real connections with genuine users. never before have i used an app this buggy and unfinished besides maybe fallout 76 and that’s saying something.",0

Very interesting app 😸,2
"I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.",1
I am unable to log in to threads!! I don't have an Instagram account. Is there no other way to log in?,2
Good,2
Super app big thanks to zuck and meta developers for all the work that you do for us ♥️,2

Threads is a best social media platforms many best features I love it,2
Only accounts with blue tick and big accounts who can get attentions and traffic. No one will see your post/thread If your account have low followers and don't have blue tick,0
"No tags, no trending just a good copy of twitter with low features and full of insta vibes... Please make the interface looks like real",0
"The app just doesn’t work in the EU. Mind you, I’m based in the US but traveling across Europe at the moment. It doesn’t work even with a VPN. So if you are heading here any time soon, keep in mind you won’t be able to use the app at all.",0

Ahh so good app with attached Instagram and I'm so happy after download this app,2
"I'm cool with this. But seriously, need a timeline of just the people I follow, yeah? Keep a discover tab or something for this, but I wanna know what the people I'm following are saying. Otherwise, what's the point? Also, an easy way to group people I follow, so that all my cat pictures are in one group, all my charity updates are in another, etc.",1

Way better than Twitter.,2

"Don't like this, their should be 0 star option too in rating",0
Stupendous,2
I'm rating 4 stars. The app itself is not so good for use but it has built a large community. May be in future they introduce all the other features. Right now there are so few things to do here. But I hope it will become better than other platforms.,1

"Not measuring up to twitter. The search function doesn't shop threads content, only people . My main way of using twitter was to find out what was going on or what people were talking about in real time and join the conversation... but app does not allow this.",0
"UI/UX of this application sucks, like there is no option to create a new account from threads app, imagine if someone had to create an instagram account in order to create threads app. Chat function must be added if you guys want active users, cuz if user can chat here the might spend more time than just scrolling the feed so i threads will only attract the users which they already have so threads might not be long lasting....",1

"change the ""remove"" button in follower list to ""Follow Back""",2
Good,2
Need more features and better data collection policies.,2
"So far I’m really liking this app, but there are many key features that are missing that I feel should have been present with the initial release. Here is a list of features I think this app should have to thrive (especially to compete with twitter wink wink)

1. Please for the love of god add an option to upload photos in 4K. The whole point of having an app to compete with twitter is to have photos in amazing quality. How’s the time to actually do your part and integrate that feature

2. An edit option (cmon now…) this should already be in the app as a feature. Let us edit posts.

3. Discover tab and following tab. There should be a tab or filter that allows you to only see posts of the people you follow. No one wants to see these celebrities that genuinely no one gives a rats behind about. Also a discover tab will allow people to find users or posts through hashtags or by allowing people to see whatever is trending. 

4. If you want to be better than Twitter then let us download videos the same way we can download photos. Cmon bro it’s not that hard just make it work. 

5. I know this is a shot in the dark but…there should really be an option for censoring posts, which allows nsfw to exist on the app without harming people who don’t want to see it. Allowing a disclaimer to show before viewing a post is a good way to do so. 

6. Allow users to create lists of their favorite accounts/posts so they can easily go back to them and find what they liked in the past. 

7. Include a tab on the account for photos/videos only similar to a gallery. 

8. Allow people to make group chats and dm each other privately.

9. Longer video upload duration 

10. Allow us to edit/crop photos or videos before posting. And also let us schedule posts/save drafts.

I think all these things will really improve the app and allow it to thrive as much as we all want it to. So take it into consideration (:",1
This app has a Chinese tracker built in. It says it's safe but it isn't!! I was being tracked secretly. My phone says this app has been using my location 24/7. DELETE THIS APP IMMEDIATELY!!!,0
What is the difference from Instagram and Twitter? Copy paste doesn't solve anything. You should have come up with an innovation. Downloading 100 m + is not a success like me most of them will delete the app and wont use it.,0

Now I will delete this app in peace, and so I won't have any FOMO.",0

"I hope to provide a better review in the future.

For those of us who joined Threads to get a Twitter alternative, we may not have an interest in Instagram itself. However, the Threads app does not provide a way to create an account — only login to any existing one. That’s sort of unwelcoming and means that we would have to download Instagram to create an account, which seems like an unnecessary step.",0

Yeah because now that Twitter's Free Speech we're going to make an authoritarian website basically identical to Twitter but now we can weed out what we want and make people act and say what we want and we dont like something we can make it so no one ever sees it.,0

One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on that,1
Quit copying other apps.,0
Bad experience,0
"The app doesn't even work. Every time I go to make a post it kicks me out. Same as when I comment. When I open my app I see the posts from people I follow but as soon as I refresh I see posts from people I don't follow.

Good,2
Good application for threads,2
♥️,2
"Dreadful. Functionality clearly needs more months of testing. No DMs. When writing a message you have to manually scroll the tab down to see what you're typing. No trending or subject matter.

Why can't my name be name (not app nickname or whatever) be different than the one on my Instagram account. I use these apps for different reasons.

I don't want to be a slave to your mediocre algorithm.,0

I just tried it and this is my opinion. I would give it a zero if it was there cuz its just a worse copy of twitter. And what si that layout like I'm not a left handed. Meta just has taken twitter and made everything diffrent on their style and suddenly made it worse. Switch to twitter it is way simpler and better!,0

While writing we cannot select words on double click. Its good if You can fix it in next release. Else everything looks pretty fun. Great to see competition for tweeter. Keep rocking meta,1

"Threads, an Instagram app is a big no-no for me. The app is glitchy, slow, and boring. It's like a bad version of Twitter that nobody asked for. Why would I want to use another app to share text updates and join public conversations when I can already do that on Instagram or Twitter? The app also makes me nervous about my privacy and security, as it may share my data with third parties without telling me. Threads, an Instagram app is not worth my time or my phone's memory.",0
"1. Although no ads in threads, but too much algorithmic content on feed which I don't really like. 2. You have to login with your Instagram account. You cannot create new account by email or phone number. 3. Once you created threads account you cannot delete it. If you want to delete, then you have to delete your Instagram account as well because threads account is interlinked with Instagram. 4. There is nothing new UI & UX. Looks like Twitter. Almost same UI. 5. No Chat option. No Hashtag",0

Want to like it so bad but it's not good. You can't search for anything but other accounts. You can't type in any words in the search bar and find other people talking about the same thing.

Not big fan of copycat apps!,0
Good app so far. A few requests: 1: Themed icon support for Android 13. 2: double tapping the search icon should go to the search page and show the keyboard (like other apps do) as this speeds up searching. 3: customisation like colours and things. Hopefully this will replace that other app..!,2
"Havent been able to use it since i dl it, just keeps saying sorry, something went wrong 🤷",0
"App that was definitely just dropped because people were fussing about twitter again and don’t get me wrong because I’d love to see new competition so twitter will step up and stop making dumb decisions, but as of now, why would I have any reason to use threads? Profiles are boring and messy, no customization besides changing your icon and putting a link, no pinned posts or some sort of media tab, no way to browse people you ACTUALLY follow, and what was the point of flexing no ads if the following feed is brand after brand after brand anyways?   There’s also no dms. 
Uninstalled after muting over a hundreds accounts, random celebrities and tiktok stars and brands I’ve never even heard of just keep appearing. Not worth your time, just keep using instagram because really, what’s the point of this app with how empty it is? Maybe in the future they will add dms and options to pin posts or have a media tab, but I legitimately can’t believe people were hyping up what’s half of a finished app",0

Nice to have options,2
Too sweet,2
Copy cut off twitter... Audience don't like it because of twitter already this type app in market,0
Wish I'd done more research before downloading this app. Feed is filled with posts from people I don't follow and it's impossible to find posts from people I do. Now I can't delete it or Meta will also delete my Instagram account so that's how they trap you into keeping it. Turning off all notifications on this app and just won't use it since it's junk. Wish there was an option for zero stars!,0
It's work slow,1
I absolutely love this app and the people here are nice. I can’t wait to see what new updates bring to the app.,2

It looks kinda cluttered",0

1. App is awesome 2. The only reason of mine for giving 3 stars is that it's not showing the posts of accounts that I follow on Instagram.Some random posts are coming even though I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times.Please fix this!!,1
Infinite scroll not working properly 😐😑,1
I love the app keep everything the same accept make it 21 and older !!,1
"i’ve been looking for a way out of twitter for a while because the platform has been turned into a worse place than it already was. but there’s no real alternative to twitter. until threads. it has the backing of Meta, it doesn’t have a “buy verification here” button, and the oligarchical billionaire that controls it mostly keeps to himself. the platform is still in its early stages and is missing many vital features you’d usually see in a social media platform, but i have hope for the future. sadly for NSFW creators, they’re stuck on twitter.",1
Not good app,0
"It would be great if I were able to follow back people. Their ""spam trap"" has me as a false positive. I have submitted a support ticket 3 times & replied to their Thread about the problem several times, but no response. It's beyond frustrating and I'm almost ready to delete my account. If the problem gets fixed, I'll add more stars to my rating and change my review.",0

It's a good app but ever since I downloaded it my Instagram has never been the same I've been restricted and can't use my Instagram I don't remember going against the guidelines can you please make threads less connected to Instagram it really sucks,1
"A clearly well built app on a technical level, but god is it just so lame. Its like twitter (obv) except people only tweet Instagram captions with no picture. The lack of a trending tab, while making the app less doomery, also makes threads feel less interconnected and social.",0
Hehe I’m the first review,2
Good applicatoin,2
"Like most people are saying, the app is decent. It does need more features. You can't save photos or videos from your feed. It also needs a view media only mode. I believe that eventually everybody will migrate from Twitter over to this app, once the updates & new features come in.",1

"Threads collects the following data that’s linked to your identity: ﻿﻿Health & Fitness, Financial Info, Contact Info, User Content, Browsing History, Usage Data, Diagnostics, Purchases, Location, Contacts, Search History, Identifiers, Sensitive Info, and Other Data. This is of course absolutely ridiculous, predatory, and highly invasive, just as you’d expect from Meta.",0

"Have you ever wondered what twitter would be like if it was run by a suppressive socialist or fascist government? Wonder no longer.

Apparently this app takes all your bank account info because one day after using the app all my money just disappeared for Instagram advertising charges which I did not allow. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP,0
"I love this app!!! Extremely addicting 🤣 but anyways I wanted to recommend something slight, I would love an option for a post to be ""close friends"" like on Instagram stories I would be elated! Because I am shy writing silly things infront of my extended family. (It would be 5 stars if the app had this option)",1
Amazing experience,2
Pathetic and the most confusing app.,0
Very good app,2
glitching a lot,0
"It's not bad but it has some way to go before it can compete with Twitter. For me personally the app is just too basic and lacks features. Also, not a fan of not being able to register via email rather than through instagram. Obviously it's still early days but I'll be uninstalling for now.",0

"Predictably as censor-heavy as Facebook, which has publicly stated that their ""fact-checkers"" are utilizing mere opinion to shut down opposing viewpoints. Effective as an echo chamber for non-dissenting discourse. Not effective for honest conversations about important topics.",0
This is a poor imitation of Twitter. The app isn't good and it isn't fun at all.,0
Nice app💯💯💯,2
"I'm really loving threads so far. My only suggestions would be to provide having multiple accounts logged in like Instagram does, and some UI customization like themes and colors, maybe headers for our accounts.",2
"For the past several weeks, Instagram has been banning my 13 year-old account that I mostly use to read family members’ updates  every 5-7 days. I send them the “proof of life” photo, they review my account and say “whoops our bad” and restore the account. Then a week later they make the same mistake. Rinse and repeat.

Do you want to give access to a company that is that incompetent all your personal data? Scroll down to the description of what information this app collects about you. That’s not necessary to run a short posting service. It is necessary to run a business where they sell your data to other businesses.

Meta/Facebook/Instagram shouldn’t be trusted to do anything in your best interest, and they know A LOT about you.",0

It's a good start. But it needs a lot of new features. Especially a timeline for posts only from accounts you follow.,1

"threads wishlist:
- Following feed, separated from For You/public feed
- Drafts
- Pronouns
- Edit posts/replies
- Close friends integration
- Profile banner
- Thread groups/filters (personally tag and filter out certain people from seeing a thread, etc.)

Meta’s Twitter alternative has the basic features of Twitter to compete. Post a thought, reply to others thoughts. But as I use the two, I can’t help but notice the things that are missing. If threads hopes to compete with existing platforms in the conversation space, it needs to adopt and adapt quickly.",1

I wish the photos/videos/reals not take up most of the page and makes it feels like another insta app ! Likes to be as close as Twitter copycat and let the priority rest on the text and people's posts mostly ! Wish there is an easier option to weed ourselves out of all those insta followers to follow us back here,1

Highest priority feature request 🚨:

I love the fact that you can add links with your post and I feel more engaged more personable then on Instagram. I hate how political Twitter has become. I hope that Threads does not do the same thing. You can change the prompt to just see the people that you are following but I actually want to meet new people so I am leaving it as it is for sure.,2

that being said, there is room for improvement. i would like it if they added hashtags, their data privacy policy is concerning, and you should be able to delete your threads account without deleting your instagram. thats all, other than that, ive been having a lot of fun",1

I am deleting this app. It shows too many random people I don’t follow. It is filled with people I do not know or want to know.  I spent half my time just like on Instagram deleting all these people and ads of random crap. I only want to see people I follow. All these social media apps are a waste of time when you have to wait through all the stuff they fill your feed with.,0

Will be sending my complaint to the consumer protection division of the Attorney General’s office. There is no valid reason for my financial data to be accessed by the app and in order to delete the data you must delete instagram and destroy your business accounts.

Privacy nightmare it is when you become a marketing object in meta ecosystem. There's no option to sign-in using using an email or any other ID. Ultimately by using your Instagram login you're exposing yourself too much for a company's business over the Internet showing your activities and views. That's even if you don't post anything because app tracks you 24/7.,0
I will share my feedback after 2-3 months.,1

Its a good App tbh ... ❤️,2
"Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ... That would be nice 👍 If you are Threads development reading this, I'm using Android,... Oh and GIFs. I have to use an app, save them and post them rather th. The keyboard on my 📱",2
Gg,2
"No point in getting this app if you want to use it to keep in touch with mutuals. You will not see who you follow on your feed, even if you change the settings to see so you follow first. You only get to see for posts at most by who you follow, after that, you just get recommended accounts who are verified and only post twitter screenshots. I hate twitter so only seeing twitters negativity is really disappointing. 

Even if you’re content just seeing certain mutuals, if you accidentally refresh the app, you’ll never find whatever posts you were looking at, posted by your following, ever again. Your best bet to see all of who you follow Is to individually check all of their profiles daily. Who has time for that though? Might as well just take following people on the app off. Really disappointing for small creators. Not even upset for myself, just want to support my friends. Genuinely impossible. 

Another thing, pictures upload in  bad quality just line Instagram. 5 second videos take 5 minutes to upload. You have to click on the video and full screen it if you want to listen to it, with Instagram, don’t even have to click the video. You just turn up your volume and that’s why I love instagrams. 

Praying they fix that following feed issue or it’ll be the apps biggest downfall tbh.",0

"The app works fine, but you can't search topics by key phrases or hashtags which means the experience feels extremely curtated and walled off. The good parts about Twitter is that it made easy to discover new people to follow based on what they said as well as find authors and artists you wouldn't have found otherwise. Threads makes so you can't really do that. You can only follow people you already know exist and can't see art by people you don't follow or such.",0

"This app doesn't even have good features! It just got fame due to Twitter's outage. App UI is horrible! Doesn't even have stuff to do in here. Only good thing is that it uses your Instagram ID as login and you have the option to follow all the people you followed in Instagram, that's a neat feature! APP WILL DIE WITHIN 6 MONTHS!",0

I think Twitter (elon musk)will revenge soon 🤞😂,0
"Thank you Meta for creating a great alternative to Twitter. I can already feel a safer, more enjoyable space - thank you!!!

Some issues: Easy to use, but no use of hashtags. You have to log out to sign into a different account. If you wish to delete your account, it will also delete your Instagram account. 

Overall though, Threads is solid. Easy to use. Reliable and overall content is better. People are happier on Threads vs Twitter. This is the app we have been asking for!!",1

Nice,2
Yeah! Here is the new Social Media Application by Instagram which is something cool and interesting one to share your Thoughts & Views..... and what not.....😇,1
Create your own Lists is Not a Feature. Only Following permitted makes this like Other New Social Platforms. It's Limiting & Not Convenient like Twitter for Grouping Numerous Topics & User Sources to review Easily. Meta obviously linked Threads Platform with Instagram quickly with little Value of Users regarding Lists. Is Follow Only better for Digital Data Capitalism? Hopefully it will Evolve. Does Threads have Follow Limit like Twtr for Users with Few Followers which having Lists increases?,0
Nothing but instgram 2.0,0
"The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.",1

BETTER ONE,2
This app will be make you fool,0
Wonderful,2
"Being a first-week user, I've experienced improvement and better stability in just 10 days. Features are hearty at launch, learning curve is very low. Not pornified, no crypto bro or tabloid ad bombs (yet). Very stoked for Threads.",2
It’s a job well-done. Thumbs up.,2
Not interested this app 👎 Twitter is best 👍,0
Omohh we die here🤭😂😂❤️,2
I can already say Threads will end up being better than Twitter.,2
It's gud,2
"Theads ! A unique name with a new experience by Instagram,it's crazy and easy to use because of attachment of Instagram account,which access people easily. And it's amazing.",1
i would give it 5 but it keeps on bugging so i'll just give it 4. it's easy to use but it's so frustrating coz it keeps on bugging,1
I don't have an opinion to switch to dark theme,0

Good 😊,2
Better than twitter,2
Imitação do twitter só que ruim.,0
Pretty well to navigate. A little hard to branch off to find similar users. But my biggest hate and the reason why I give 3 stars is the constant spam of verified users that I don't care about. Their brands do not suit my taste and it's always a large scrolling process to skip past them.,1
Its only for insta user. Poor interface. Fake review,0
Nice app,2
why my threads looks so messy?,0
"Loving this Twitter-killer app, so desperately needed since Elon took over. Sure, it’s not yet a fully mature app, not right out of the gate, but they’ll get there. But it seems stable and responsive and it’s help up well so far with the tsunami of new users. Bravo!",1

"- Needs a timeline for only the people you follow

- Needs hashtag support / a way to search for tweets outside of your timeline 

Other than that the experience is very smooth especially for the first day.",1
Not working properly 😔,0
Copy of Twitter,0
There are some glitches while using this app like when i scroll the app please fix that,0
"On day one I was blocked from posting images shortly after launch, then that transferred to my gram account as well. Every image post gets flagged as violation, no one is responding to review requests, both apps are now unusable for me and I’m left with the worst customer experience and frustration. I’m an artist and this effects my business. Terrible experience going back to twitter where I thought things are bad, but after this experience I see that it’s so much better there…",0

An app for this is idiotic. There is nothing this app can do that a web page can't. I don't put garbage apps on my phone and this is firmly in that category.,0

It’s like Twitter but without the toxic sludge that is your average Twitter addict. 7.5/10,2
Bagus,1
Gathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.,0
Threads need some translation cause being an international kpop fan is so hard when there's no translations,1
Useless & a complete waste of time,0
I accidentally “joined” this app and I cannot remove the badge even though there is an option to do so. It keeps coming back when I refresh. Is there anyway to stop that from happening?,0
Murge this threads in instagram like reel button...... It seems like we are using two same instagram accounts in different apps,0
A very bad experience,0
"I don't want to see post from people I don't follow, I only want to see things from those I follow. Don't force feed us other companies or people, if you must do that have it on a separate tab.",1
It just a copy of Top E😂😂😂,0
"What is the point of creating an app that is litteraly facebook but as an instagram surfer. Moreover, you are copying twitter with all its specs and you got a new way not only to know every single detail about our lives but to actually know every single word we want to say. Try hard app!",0
Very disgusting app.... Don't compare it with Twitter . Twitter is much better than threads.very useless app.Dont waste ur data in download this app.,0
"upload gallery file problem no show gallery folder 📂, only show gallery photo video mix",0
I don't want to use both Twitter and Instagram in same app it sucks..🤣😆,0
"Stop recommending accounts/post on my feed that I don’t follow. What’s the point in following accounts that you want to follow if your feed is overshadowed by account/post recommendations that you do not follow. Just annoying seeing mostly content that you don’t want to see. If I wanted to see it, I would have followed them. If I wanted recommendations, I would have went to the recommendations section. I’ll give a better review once this is fixed.",1
"Why a separate app,just integrate this with Instagram too many apps too much space",1
not good,0
Batter then Twitter 🌿😄🐍,2
Missing bookmark option😐,1
This is Facebook in the format of Twitter. A strength of Twitter has always been that it let you decide whether or not you wanted to be anonymous….not so much with threads,0
Good,1
Good appp 💝💝🥀,2
Very basic,2
"i’m already loving this app but i need gifs. also i think it should have a based on what you like algorithm!! other than that, love it.",1
Coz !! Our official account can be deleted if we delete threads !! So badd,0
add manual dark mode feature asap,0
"Nice attempt on copying Twitter but I find some things not so comfortable in this app. For example, I can't separate posts in a feed between recommendations and my follows. It's just a huge list of endless publications from people I don't know and don't care about. Also it would be great to have ""save media"" button.",0
Great twitter alternative This realy twitter killer app Go ahead mark zuck 👍,2
mark zuckerberg vs elon musk fight 🤜🤛,2
Very good app 💯,2
No widgets? Really? Have a scrollable full screen widget.,0
Like how they freaking copy it. It should be stopped.,0
hey.This is another matrix,0
"Porn, only fans, black supremacy and hatred in every other post. Not a place for equality, all the onlyfans, porn, racism, child porn sharing and trash came straight from Twitter over here. If anything it’s worse than Twitter because reports are ignored. Porn is up for a week and still not taken down  

App needs to be 18+ nudity isn’t even blurred, it’s forced on you as you scroll. Age requirements should be 18+ up and stay that way. Drug content already posted. 
I don’t care what you people do in your private messages and groups but Threads is already being bombarded with this. 

Moderation needs to do something. Otherwise, everyone should know that Threads is the Wild West version of Instagram, you can at this time get away with whatever racist remarks or pornography your heart desires. They don’t care in here",0
There is limitation for writing threads i hope you guys will make it.anyways good app for everyone.,1
This app name should be Twister 😁,1
I don't think it's a new app I'm a Quality Assurance engineer software's I seem this app same as Twitter with different name n logo also there's a bug init,0
So much mb,1
"This app surprisingly is a lot like Twitter minus a lot of the negative stuff. But it's clean sleek you. I really shows you how little there is to do on either platform. You can't direct message anybody, it's even hard to see what my friends are actually saying. My whole feed is a bunch of people I've never met, I don't follow, and no one's reposting it that I follow. Overall a solid experience compared to Twitter but somehow this app makes you realize how boring it is.",0
amezing,2
Feels like this app is full of dumb people's. Not a intellectual people of community. Also the data & privacy is not secure.,0
"It doesn show the replies in posts. It shows something went wrong. The only screen that works is the wall, for all the others it shows something went wrong. How possible a giant company makes such a trash application",0
At the point the name should be twitter’s rip off not threads. I log into threads and what do i see? Instgram posts transformed into threads so what’s the point of threads if I’m just going to see instagram posts I already saw on INSTAGRAM? It’s instgram in the shape of twitter that’s what threads is.,0

The app needs to have a way where we can look at content that we like like to see like art, music, and games. We need a save function to save images and videos or even threads that we like to see.

Update fixes this issue🖤 - Good.

Try again later"" no matter what i did, it just would not work, so I can't even use it anyways, what the point of using up storage space. I like the idea though, it's just too early. Maybe I'll reinstall it in a couple weeks? A month? 2 months? How long do you think it takes to get all the glitches out?",1

@globalrealtor _ An App that is very functional catches my fancy.

has potential. would love to see chronological order and the option to see posts from those you follow. atm it doesn't really matter who you follow since it's really a small chance you will even see their posts.,1
The interface has miniclones of itself all over the place and they are overlapping each other. Can't see anything clearly.,0
First of all it's great tbh of course it needs some work to be done but it's very new and u can report anything and they fix it fast how far it goes for me as a new app it's amazing,2

vice versa if i like someones threads, i can easily follow their instagram to support them. liking the idea so far!",2

I Def think it needs a translation button incase your following someone that doesn't type English and u would have to copy the sentence then search it up but all in all I love it,1
"there's some flaws I've noticed . 1. Reply in thread goes far way bottom, not the below of the thread that meant to be replied 2. Text cursor doesn't follow my typing, need to scroll by myself if it's a long thread 3. I can't save images 4. can't 2x tap to zoom image, I must pinch it to zoom and it's doesn't stay still zooming the image, it always goes back to original size. 5. Video UI/UX is not very interactive and intuitive, can't tell the duration 6. No media bar in profile 7. No hastags",1
Cool,1
great,2
I don't see the value.,0
Waste of time and energy,0
Not much,1
Very interesting and beautiful friend and my phone I love you Threads app very Nice app and android device Version,2
Just twitter space is left to copy now,0
Nice app,2
Great app 😁,2
Good app,2
This app is decent however I don’t like that it’s hard to find threads that people you follow post,1
Annoying like Instagram. Spending all day muting people I don't wanna see. Can't change color theme. Like Twitter but with more noise and less control.,0
When I logged in to the app it showed me a huge bug . The company of the app is need to be solve the problem neither it will be going a huge trouble for the users. Really very disappointing.,0
Not working High lag 😭😭,0
✨️,2
Would rate it higher if the translate feature can be integrated like in Facebook and Instagram,1
"The application is very bad, there are many problems, but rather a program and it takes me out of the application without any reason when I click on the comments",0
Wow That's amzing tools for young generation. 🤩,1
"We didn't know how it is , I want to see how it work",1
Great app,0
Definitely a lot of features missing but I’m sure they’ll be added. Such as a chronological feed and seeing only who you follow. Another one I don’t see much talk about is for videos a slider to control it(I’d like if we could slide left to right like in default apple video player). Lastly two small things are to double tap to zoom not this pinch to zoom and it doesn’t stay and when you swipe to refresh give it some haptic feedback.,1
Toti app,0
"I dont want to see algorithmic content at all, but the userbase and integration with Instagram is nice",1
Nice app as a Twitter 👍,1

First review with words,2
Good Compititor to Twitter,1
"we want zuckerberg to make a seperate dm for threads , trending stories for local location and worldwide and an edit button.",1
Requires insta login… deleted,0
"Overall I think the app is pretty good for it being just released but as of now the only thing i can think  of that would make it a lot better for me personally is a section for threads you don’t want to post yet or just want to keep to yourself— essentially drafts. There have been many threads i have wanted to draft just to keep them for myself but can’t because the app simply doesn’t have that feature as of now, but i hope that as the app develops and updates more that we will have it in the future along with many other things",1
Spy App don't download.,0
App is too much glitchy,0

"It feels too much Instagram to replace Twitter. Sorry, but no.",0
It's very good app in use and ir will replace Twitter one day🤗,2
Make it so we can log in without Instagram. I don't have nor do I want an Instagram account,0
Leveraging the power of the existing ecosystem of 2 billion users is a boss move against Twitter... it's a ZuckerPunch!!! I'm here for the ride... Let's go.,2

I downloaded a game about a button and the button game went off my phone faster. This is literally Twitter except empty because no one is using it yet so start a thread so this app can have text,0
Good app for......,2
Hi meta Threads is a great app.I love ur app. And I want to tell that always keep update ur app so you can beat twitter. Thanks,2
Nice update,2
"I realize the app is in its infancy, but this thing is really inconvenient. I can only use the app from my phone to post. I can't use it on my laptop at all, not even taking something from my Instagram page and crossposting. Please fix this. Allow us to post from devices other than just phones. I have failing eyesight and this becomes a real problem for me because my phone screen (and anything I write using it) is so small.",0
"Won’t let me post, and won’t let me add a second thread. Extremely buggy right now. Assuming it’s the demand causing problems. But imo should have been rolled out exclusively not to mass market",0

"Yrr tumhara app baar baar khud band ho rha h, Mai kisi thread ke thread ke thread ko kholu to khud app poora band ho rha h aur doobara kholne par m jis point pe tha wo sab refresh ho kar vanish .... Instagram team, aap se support aur solution ki ummed h 🙁",0
"It’s a copycat app that requires too many permissions. In addition, it is an anti-science app that is dangerous to the world as the very nature of science requires we ask questions. So when there’s a pandemic or some other disaster only biased information is allowed.",0

"There's a lot to be desired for on this app I would like to see a ""This person follows you"" badge on someone's profile who follows me. A feed option of only accounts that I do follow. And most of all, being about to choose specific folders from my gallery to post pictures and videos from. The app is smooth, but uploading photos sometimes crashes it. Otherwise I can see this being a potential killer for Twitter.",1
Love the lack of Nazis and money not being funneled to sex traffickers by the app,2
"I downloaded the threads app, was logged in just fine. I even made two posts.
Now, every time I tap the icon to create a post, or to comment on a thread, I'm kicked off the app and find myself on my iPad home screen.
Problems happen. I understand that.
But I hope there's a fix to this soon. 
I'll give one star because I can't give none.",0

The fact that you cant delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram tells you how much zuck cares about your privacy. We dont need another text app,0

Be sure to read what data collection this app gets access to. There is NO reason for it to need that much of your personal data. Also interface is bad.,0
"Major fail if there is no way to see trends.  The appeal of Twitter is to get RT info.  Without that feature, I am not interested.   I don’t want to follow a ton of people to up my chances of see what’s happening.  

I hope to be able to edit my rating.  For now, am not going to use this app",0
Nice app 👌,1
So Much Bugs In The App ! nothing Superb Features Copied Everything From Twitter,0
The app is nice but please we need a poll feature.a pin to profile feature and a direct message feature that's all.,1
Love it,2
"It's a good app ...but then things need to be corrected ... Work on typing, You need to see what you are typing ... Not just typing blindly.. ,,,while using the app replying a post with a photo media the media blocks your view and you can't see what you are typing ... Plus the post button should be easily accessible.. Work on interacting with your users that's why your notification is there.

"Discovery is difficult, any post of advertising creator merch on there will be hidden from discovery instantly without notice, so smaller creators who use this platform will end up having issues, i did it as a one time experiment using my creator account @pandaherocommunity and it was hidden publicly on the threads browser, currently only my public personal account is getting discovery benefits, but post engagement is close to zero.",0
This app is the better social media platform I have ever seen its easy to use and become famous.,1
Good,2
NYC,2
Boring,0
it looks really good but the biggest negative for this app is the linking to Instagram. a lot of times on twitter like apps I do not want people knowing my real name because people are crazy and having a shown username and hidden real name can protect people who don't want to use their real name out of fear of harassment or stalking,1
Wasn't able to open the app after download,0

"Great app, but I think 2 issues have to be fixed,, First, it's gonna be better if the pictures/photos are downloadable, Second, when writing using 2 languages like Arabic & English in one thread, the order of the text gets messed up, so for a socialmedia where writing threads is the thing, I believe fixing this issue is necessary. Overall, creating this platform and this app is a great idea.",1

Do you love all the aspects of twitter except for the fact you get opinions on your feed that aren’t 100% aligned with your views 😠 well this is the app for you! It is literally a copy of Twitter except they’ll ban you for saying the wrong thing! Don’t bring up Hunter Bidens laptop because that’s an untouchable subject. Don’t you dare question the efficacy of a mandatory experimental vaccine because that’s bigoted! The FBI or CIA doing more illegal activities to their own citizens? Don’t bring it up on Threads because Zuck is bought and paid for by big government.,0
it's okay but when I found out about how I can't uninstall the app 😭,0

I think it's more interesting than Twitter ✨,2
Great app,2
"Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.",0
"The app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 2 stars is just because of these bugs.",0
Good app,2
amazing app .. 😀,2
I can’t even see the posts of people I follow. It just shows the posts of annoying randos.,1

Makes Elon mad 10/10,2
"Well there are several features that I hope available in this app such as data saving (autoplay disabling), media downloading, and trending.",1

Great 👍,1
I personally doesnt like how this app worked...,0
Seriously i am unable to login always saying check few minutes later. I tried after 2 hours still saying try few minutes later. It suck,0
Very useful aap,2

"the lowkey version of twitter, but I liked it though...",2
"Every time I try to write an actual post, the app just crashes, so this app is basically unusable for me.",0
Very Good. Just wow,2
"This is the most compelling alternative to Twitter there is. Quick, responsive, and with a growing and continually engaging community, I foresee great things for Threads. Being Instagram adjacent certainly helps as well. As long as new features continue to roll out, and the community sticks with it, it’s looking like Threads continues to be a winner.",2
Good,2
There is a lot of room to improve but it is a good start though.,1
Very good,1
Brand new,2

disappointed app ask me to download it from Appstore when sharing images but guess what 🙂 I am using android and downloaded it from play store,0
App has great potential,2
This app is so much better than Facebook I would say. I think its just new app thats why this is kinda fun and good but after when this app got famous or something this will be worse Ikr. Anyways lets see,1
This is literally pointless app.,0
Yes we can,2
Love it!,2

Its not Twiter,2
Bhai kya bawal cheez h ab to Twitter ki jarrorat he nhi hogi 😅,2
"I know it’s brand new, just putting my suggestion out. We need a bookmarks section to save threads we like.

I do wonder why this wasn’t simply added as a section within the Instagram app though. I would’ve liked that better.",1

It's a great app. But i hope it can have a smooth interface when login into multiple accounts like Instagram.,1
"Implement the ""following-only"" feature then this app would be perfect.",0
Perfect,2
Nice,1
"Right now all I can rate this app is 3 stars. It’s generally pretty good, the layout is great and it feels much less toxic than what it’s trying to replace which is always a plus. Unfortunately, there’s some issues that I can’t get past without docking points. There’s no direct messaging feature, that coupled with the need of an instagram account to use the app means that this is not a standalone app but more of an addition to Instagram. Also, the algorithm isn’t the best. It’s difficult to curate your feed to stuff you want to see, like specific topics, which is something some users are already leaving over. All in all, still better than Twitter.",1

It's good 👍🏼,1

"I really like the UI. I have never used Twitter(i do have a ac) coz most people I know don't use it. But since this is a part of Instagram most would start one. It would be really helpful if I could switch between different accounts just like in Instagram. It's a hassle to everytime log out, confirm the login and use the other account.",1
Am I the first one reviewing this app?,2
Bb,2
"I'm very dissapointed, but I hope this is because this app is very new. I'd like to not see posts of people I do not follow at all, and only in English, it's annoying to come across my native language when I don't want to.",0
Why do you need Instagram to sign on? Too many ads,0
The app is crashing suddenly please fix this 😭 aside from that I like this app,1

"I wanted a replacement for Twitter, this isn’t it. The TOS was so bad I deleted FB and Instagram. I expect a foreign country to look to steal all info about us, to use it against us. These people are doing it and live here with us. They promote opposing views to cause strife with inflammatory content just to keep people on the apps. It’s not so subtly ruining our own country from inside. All for a dollar. 
One star is too much",0

"Title: Inadequate Formality: App Needs Its Own User ID, Separate from Instagram The decision to link it with Instagram is quite bad. If the app aims to establish itself as a formal platform, it must break free from this association and create its own user identification system. By relying on Instagram for user authentication, the app loses its independence and fails to establish a unique identity.",0

Posted few threads when one day everything just stopped working. I cannot post or see my posts. If I go on someone else’s profile it also says “content not available”. I’ve tried so many things to fix it and it’s not being fixed. So there’s no point for me to be on it since it’s not working but I cannot now even delete my profile 👍🏻,0
Ya its app better than instagram and twitter,2
It won't let you delete your account without deleting your instagram!,0

The app is good but I hate the fact that they just changed the algorithm to see people’s post that I don’t follow. It’s extremely irritating. I only want to see who I follow and maybe have a discover page? But it’s extremely annoying seeing a thousand posts from random people who I don’t care about.,1

Super this is very useful for Instagram and secure safety🤞👏👏👏,2
Nice app,2
Renders the app useless and following as useless. The feed is dominated by what I guess are recommended or popular posts. The people you follow rarely show up. Add a following feed please.,0

Disgusting apps now Instagram has made their level down very boring application lots of advertising bugs recommended everyone to uninstall 🤧😏,0

Does not work! I can only watch feed. I cannot post anything or comment. I cannot see comments at all,0
Garbage twitter knockoff.,0
More Features Expected.,0
After a few days of using the app here are the things I hope to be updated. 1. For you feed. I see random people more than people I actually follow. 2. Hashtags. I think this will help with reach and engage with people of your niche. 3. Dark Mode option. 4. Gallery tab. It's frustrating having to scroll down just to find an image I wanted to post. 5. Writing a reply. I cannot see anything I write because the keyboard blocks it while typing. 6. Algorithm. Everything is so random at the moment.,1
You should add more features like othe apps And your app is nice for writing quotes 😊,1

It's a bit disapppointing when you tried to log in and it will ask you for your Instagram username and password. Where in when you log in with Instagram you used you Facebook credentials for it. Kinda confusing 😕,0

Installed this on day first of its launch. This app is undoubtedly good but needs a lot of improvements yet. Keep it up.,1
"This app is not useful and downloaded this app by cheating ,then we can not delete this app.",0
I downloaded & found it requires an Instagram account so just another gateway to an app i dont want. Twitter at least was stand alone but its policy on needing a mobile number puts me off using it. So Ill just stick to meeting mates for a drink & having real conversations with out enriching billionaires further.,0
Can I get this on my desktop PC?,0

It's good overall 👍 But Can you add the translate option So we can understand others language threads,2
Very good application I wanna say that this app is better then twitter,2
"It seems like a strong competitor to twitter, just needs some fixes like allowing direct messages, and when you block someone on this platform not immediately blocking them on Instagram. Just want to keep different audiences and people of different platforms.",1
I don't see anything special in this app .. its just another way of wasting our time,0
Threads for better then Twitter for simple people.,2

"the size of the app is big, bigger than its competitor, that blue bird logo app, with lesser features. 🤷🏻‍♀️ home/feeds?/timeline is quiet messy, would be nice if it can be separated between following only and trending? maybe.",1

working fine now. No lagging.,1
"Threads was fun for the first two weeks. After that it just became boring. It’s missing a lot of very basic features like drafts, bookmarking threads, ability to edit threads, and so much more. If they want it to be a “Twitter killer” they have to work a lot faster to add those things. It’s been two weeks and still nothing. Lame and boring. It only got so many people on the first day cause it is so easy to sign up for. Just use your Instagram login. Other than that, there is really nothing special about Threads. It’s just a Twitter clone but a very boring version of it.",1

Good app ever....,2
Elon Musk dislikes this app,2
"Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions. They're all visible in one place, unlike to the other confusing and dizzying platform called Twitter. <3 LOL",2
Nice app but why am I unable to send threads to my friends via the app itself?,1

This app is impressive. But if you put the setting like ig following and favourites. It would be amazing.,1
All I see are random posts from people I don’t care about or want to hear from. It was kinda fun to try out a new app with little effort but I gave zero interest in random posts that have nothing to do with my interests. I can block and hide all day but that’s not what I want to do.,0

"An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for.

I’m a 30 year old male…I never cared to have an instagram…sooo don’t waste your time downloading this app until they fix that HUGE issue. 🤪",0
This app sucks. It's key problem is that it CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM. Do not download this app. I don't see many people using it either. It asks for many permissions when creating an account with no warning that you cannot remove the threads link from your profile or delete your account. It's a data miner with no benefits.,0
Nice app better than twitter,2

"I think when we get better functionality like the ability to only see posts from who we follow, and maybe edit abilities, it will be great. The potential is there.",1
"This is almost a perfect replacement for Twitter minus one thing. This app needs a way to tell the algorithm to show fewer recommendations like these. Right now I have no way to train the algorithm to show me posts that would keep me scrolling. It either needs the option to show more or show less similar content like we have on the Google app’s homepage or we need a way to limit what we see to the accounts we have followed. Once that is added, this looks to be a five star worthy app!",1

it's originally developed to beat twitter but it cannot take twitter users. it is a mere copy of twitter and another form of instagram. it will divide instgram users but twitter users will stay where they belongs. as Elon says free of speech is the key to the platform but Threads lacks of it.,0

Good 👍,2
Needed to move away from Twitter so bad. Threads is great and is scaling really well so far. Clean interface and fun to use! Bye bye Elon' dumpster fire called Twitter!,2

Good🤝,2
"I know there are tons of updates coming but Twitter will show the ANNOYING “refresh feed” icon under the front camera, which when pressed sends you to the VERY TOP of your feed. Threads has the same. thing. 

Twitter at least allows you to close the app from your Home Screen, re open Twitter, and the icon is gone BUT you remain at the same place where you were previously scrolling. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE allow users to do this on BOTH Instagram and Threads. I see a post I’m about to repost, like, or reply to, and then my feed refreshes where I lose the post forever. It makes me not want to use the Threads app!!",1

"Yet another facebook product. facebook is a main contributor to all the things that has lead to our present day misery. It has divided our families, our friends, our country, and even the world. I can not trust facebook. Their algorithms will continue to encourage the conversations that keep us angry and intolerant of others. And they will keep us from going out and living our lives fully in the moment. This is just another app to capture some photo or video to post to make us feel like we’re doing cool things or really care about something.",0

"Why does this app need so many permissions? I permanently deleted Facebook from my phone because somebody told me that I was online, but i did not open the app that day. Why would this app need biometrics and reroute phone calls and reorder running apps and see your health fitness and what other apps you have and activities you're doing and all of that?? Never going to use a meta app again",0
So far it's been messy. No option to set the feed to only accounts you follow is a massive turn off. If that isn't updated soon you can expect this to flop like the rest of the twitter replacements,0

I didn't take this much time to learn features of an app. The overall user experience, animations, smoothness, are really good. Especially since it linked with insta account, I can directly use my insta bio in this app. It is totally connected to Instagram such made me easirler to find my friends.",2

"It is better to swipe left or right to hide or mute options, and please add a dark theme. Thank you.",1
Super more than facebook,2
I guess it's too early for this app to be released cuz it has a lot of issues and missing important features like: - the design is so random literally copy of Instagram with some Twitter things - profile page is so boring it doesn't even have header - how the heck there is no dark theme?? - ain't no way this app doesn't have direct messages - not even hashtags - the setting option are so little - too slow to share post or delete it - no gifs - recommending random people post not interested to,0
"It's just a Twitterised version of Instagram. Nothing more nothing else. And after a few weeks on its full of unwanted, unsavoury, bogus, fake-ish accounts that no one wanted and no one asked for. Since signing on all I've been doing is blocking and muting accounts. And the fact that it lacks so many features up until this day. Say what you will but I would rather stay in Twitter and Instagram.",0

This app died so quickly,0
"The app isn’t too bad and so far it feels like old Twitter. There are problems though. You can’t save posts, no edit function, searching for people/pages isn’t easy, and no info about what’s trending. 

I’m basically saying that I want Twitter cause honestly I still do. I’m only trying this because if anything could replace Twitter it might be Thread. Mainly because it’s the closest comp and probably the literal point of the app. 

Also why are people rooting for this? I mean that would cause Meta to have an even more disproportionate influence on social media…",1

"The app itself is a decent setup. It's slow right now but I'm sure that'll be fixed later. The main issue for me is the link between IG and threads. The appeal of Twitter is that it's a different vibe. I don't want the same name on threads as I want on my IG. This is supposed to be the least formal site. I don't keep up appearances on Twitter, but I do on IG.",1

"It's ok. Interaction bar needs to follow the comment, repost, like, share order like twitter though (it's more ergonomic to have the like button on the right side), and having the interaction numbers clearly visible instead of a dark grey which is hard to read. Still needs hashtags, a proper search feature, and trending topics. Need a home feed with only people I follow. Good for release, missing key features.",1

This app was unusable because of serious glitches. I couldn't see or scroll anything. To make things worse when I redownload the app I can't even login and app is keep crashing.

"The app first appeared to be a well structured version of Twitter and I had high hopes for this app, until the moment I reached the home page. The main home page is filled with nothing but posts from people I don’t even follow. I understand these big companies need to make money and paid posts are a thing as much as we hate them. But the thing that’s most annoying is that we thought this would be an app for us IRL friends to connect with one another by allowing us to choose not to follow celebrities or big companies but yet we can’t get away from them and my friends posts are nowhere to be seen. Feels like just another big tech app putting money before the users.",0

"Threads is the single greatest waste of time I ever came across. 98% of my feed filled with posts from users I don't even follow. People I follow aren't engaging with those posts either. Just feels like spam. I have spent more time reporting posts like this as spam, bc they're clogging up my feed. IG is already an established distraction where we are trying to keep up w our friend's businesses and shenanigans. Threads feels like a desperate outlet for incredibly bored people. Otherwise, is it just another app collecting user activity to feed a server with data?

please add a setting to limit people's posts that are just trying to go viral, excluding certain keywords (like""Elon"" 🙄) and maybe you won't lose some users",0

I don’t like that once you join your instagram and thread account are joined together and you can’t delete one with out deleting the other. I don’t like that for some reason my thread badge won’t stay removed and keeps coming back on my instagram. I also didn’t like that seen more posts from people I didn’t follow and rarely seen a post from those I had followed. It need better organization and to be its own platform not conjoined at the hip of instagram.,0

Good job!,2
This app in very good,1
"The app is obviously in its early stages, with missing features like dms and a trending page. Still, I think the app runs very smooth, looks nice, and has great potential. I’ve already seen an increase of activity as the days go by, and I’m excited to see the app grow!

To everyone who is leaving 1 star reviews, realize that this app came out less than a week ago. You have no sense of how apps work if you think they would have all functions available at once. Of course it’s not perfect, and you shouldn't expect that from ANY new app. Especially considering a new social media platform is impossibly difficult to start up. But we know it’s more than just another app review for some of you out there.",2

"Briefly speaking, this app is decent overall, just needs some more updates like editing and better thread navigation stuff to be a more viable competitor to Twitter/be “Meta/Facebook/Instagram” Twitter.

Now for the data tracking rant.

To be fair, everything ends up collecting our data in some way or form and share it with everything else on the internet at some point. Though this is Meta which is one of the few social media apps that are notoriously bad for tracking data, they do not even bother trying to hide it for this app. At least with Facebook and Instagram you at least have the option to opt out (more likely give you the comfort feeling, not necessarily completely opting out) of tracking both as a pop up and in the settings (for ads mainly). This app? It tracks basically everything, and doesn’t even prompt you at all.",0

"Been unable to post anything (or see feeds) in over 72 hours. I reported this several times, but as always with META, nobody will follow up on anything with you - or it will take weeks on end with no implications what-so-ever. And since you have no other way to contact any support (since support teams do not seem to exist at META) or report it to any misguided AI even, I remain stuck in limbo. Tried to log out and delete and reinstall, but nothing works. So I am basically rendered unable to use the app.",0

You have to log in with Instagram. Which in turn shares tons of information. So I looked at all the pictures of the app in use and realize that it is appears to be just be a copy of Twitter. Instagram and Facebook have been instrumental in censorship and data gathering and selling. I will delete it immediately.,0

"This feels like a beta version of an app. Was rolled out way too soon with the hopes of cashing in on the temporary Twitter rate limit issue. The app is a mess right now - no following tab, no way to turn off reposts from followers, no search button for topics, TL not in chronological order, no way to save pictures, no GIFs, no DMs, no Trending topics. Will never replace Twitter if these issues aren't fixed.",0
Absolutely fabulous first day. I did notice Elon's buddies coming over and complaining a lot when they went back on Twitter. But they get mad because they do s***** things and then get caught. Other than that it worked really good. Cons are it needs an edit button and it needs a way to select the type of things that you want to follow for example politics animals etc. Have a great day I was really happy to see everyone show up.,2

"This is a new platform by Meta, it may seem like a Twitter ripoff, and it is. It’s a direct competitor to the famous bird app and it a nice addition to Instagram and the Meta family in general. One thing that I really like is regardless of using your instagram account for threads, you can choose to have your Threads profile public while keeping your Instagram account private. Again, this is a new platform and my thoughts on this could change for the better or worse over time.",2

"It’s literally a copy and paste of Twitter except it collects all your data.

You can sign up only if you have an Instagram account.

Since Threads shares the same guidelines of Instagram, you can post nsfw contents and aside of that, you can’t also say whatever you want. It’s anti-freedom of speech.

If you try to say something that Meta don’t like, your Threads account could be censored or banned. If banned, you can say also bye to your Instagram account.

Last thing, if you’re unable to post, like, follow and see your activity, it probably means that you’re in EU. Since this app doesn’t respect privacy rules, Meta has decided to block all EU users from using this app. And no, using a VPN doesn’t change nothing.",0

At the moment Threads is a three star rating for me. Due to the lack of a for you page and showing people I do not follow. Not to mention the app’s slow pace in loading when it comes to getting a new follower. By all means I enjoy Threads for simply allowing us to create threads with friends. Including express our thoughts without a limit within the app (that I know of).,1
It probably would be a good app if it actually works. When I open it it glitches as soon as I scroll leaving all the posts I've scrolled past in the background. Even when I change tabs to look at my profile it remains. Uninstalling and reinstalling does nothing to solve the issue. Unusable app.,0

"Sure, I'd be happy to review Instagram Threads for you. Threads is a standalone app from Instagram that was designed to be a more personal and private way to connect with your close friends. It's a great way to share your day-to-day moments with the people who matter most to you, without having to worry about your posts being seen by a wider audience. Some of the things I like about Threads include: It's a more personal and private way to connect. Threads is only visible to your close friend",2

Like Meta has my Facebook and Instagram data and can’t even build a proper timeline of my interests. Maybe it’ll get better but until I can specifically check in on my IRL friends and accounts I’ve followed without having to go to their profiles, I really don’t see that point.",0

There's also no way to search for specific words or find trending topics, which is a huge feature this app is lacking that is severely needed. Hopefully this is something that will be added in the very near future.",1

"Hello, 

I love Thread and as someone who waited a long Time for a new platform so I can build my brand, I’m really excited about Thread.  The only thing the Developers need to work on is to bring back the  Badge. I unknowingly remove my Bring from my Instagram page now I can’t bring it back and I really need it because I’m ready to build a new space for myself. 
Aside that I think it’s going to be a really great platform.",1

I was excited for this until i finally tried it. The app technically bring your IG followers with you which make it really lousy experience for those who looking for chance on a new platform. No clear guidelines on how to get your post in front of people. Hash tags dont work like twitter & no categories like IG. Worst of all you cant delete your account. Meta is desperate to claim they have many accounts by not letting people delete it unless they delete instagram. Dont bother install it. Pure waste of time. I am better off on tiktok,0

"It's a twitter killer app, it's kinda fancy but then its major downside is its limitation to the Close Friends list, potentially restricting the user’s reach. Also, as a separate app, it might require users to switch between main Instagram and Thread apps to access the full range of Instagram features. So to me it's a 4star app",1

"The poor performance of the service was the worst part of it overall. Takes way too long for anything to load including just text which is crazy to me given Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and really any other service is generally quick even with content that is media rich. The other problem is the feed is boring. I see plenty of things that are utterly uninteresting to me despite the likely importing of my interests and data from instagram. I would have expected that that would having me seeing things that were at least semi relevant to me but that is not the case. The thing I like about twitter is the ability to curate what I want to see but the approach here seems to be that the user is not in control of what they see or don’t see. All that said if this all was improved I could see myself liking Threads but for now it’s not that great",0

Everything else is pretty okay and I expect it to get even better.

And because it's new there are THOUSANDS of ppl idk showing up on my feed. Sorry but this won't ever replace twitter. 🤣🤣,0

I like the app very much but if you think it is going to replace Twitter keep dreaming it may be in a mess right now but it is not as tuff as Facebook if you like to add certain content that is for adults that is why Twitter is not going anywhere soon plus you need to fix it so does not use a lot of battery power in the background when it is not being used,1

Trash; don't touch it. How can Facebook even call this a Twitter killer when they don't even allow NSFW or Porn on the platform. Why do you think people have flocked to Twitter for years?

"So far it's nothing new nor innovative, nor is it anything near Twitter - which is more smooth and users have more control over what is actually on their feed. That sluggish scroll this App has is very annoying and honestly quite irritating.",0
Better than twitter,2

It's Twitter competiter,2
It's So much good App,2
Nice app 👌👌,2
"Everytime I do, I get a content violation which is insane. Because none of the photos I post are against community guidelines. It’s because I “posted too much content”. What kind of a rule is that.",0

Found bugs alert !!! Its always crash when I check comments on my past threads.,0
Thank you for your contribution Sir we are still waiting for free mode on thread an Instagram account.,2
"Crashes every time I try and leave a comment, so frustrating to use",0
Not user friendly ui,0
This new app was awesome!!! The cool here is your acc is connected to Instagram!!! Not laggy and I literally enjoyed this Threads!!!,2
Elon musk did so do i,0
"Booted it up twice, both times it asked me to turn notifications on. Yeah, nah.",0
"It's very simple, boring, and boring.",0
"Not quite ready for prime time. Needs a feed specifically for accounts you follow. If you have more than one Instagram account, Threads doesn't allow easy switching between accounts without involving logging out/logging in/security confirmation. This shouldn't need to be repeated over and over. Also, it is concerning that the app is blocked in the EU due to privacy violations. Use at your own risk.",0
"Its a good app. I have accidentally unhided the ""thread badge"" from Instagram bio. Please bring an option to add it back. :(",0
Under using,2
"AWFUL, TWITTER BETTER",0
It should be linked together with IG so we can jump from Thread to Instagram without closing any app to log on another app.,2
very bad app please put options to delete account permanently...,0
Fabulous,2
What an idea . Updates pls,1
very good🔥🔥,2
"Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface",2
"Every time I use it, it logs me out of my Instagram account. Using both Threads and Instagram seem to cancel each other out, requiring me to delete Threads to be able to use Instagram. There should be an easy way to switch users on Threads without logging you out of Instagram and vice versa.",1
Good app,2
"For an app that was rushed out, I must say that it works flawlessly for the limited features provided, but there's still a very long way to go. Hope Zuck doesn't give up. So much potential, even more so than Facebook I guess. Also, I hope it'll eventually be just called ""Threads"", and not ""Threads, an Instagram app""; Hinting at a dedicated login with its own sign up and login credentials. Good luck.",2
Can't post photos,0
Just better than Twitter 👍❤️,2
Highly censored platform zero free speech.,0

I barely opened the account and I already started receiving spam messages. It is so plain. You can't customize it. It doesn't even show much besides the things that you are not interested in. This app sucks.,0
"Usless app , if any thing happen to my insta account it is ur responsiblity",0
Very fun,2
Chutiyaaaa,0
App crashed,0
Useless social media app. Fully similar look like 50% Twitter and 50% Instragram. And I have both of app. So why I use this app. Totally boring application. I can't spend my time on this app. So finally I uninstalled this boring app.😵‍💫👎🖕,0
Everything is Good,2

How can I delete my Threads account. There no such option.,1
Good experience,2
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍,2
It is a cheap copy of Twitter no one is morally allowed to make such apps as the owner of Twitter have invested billions in Twitter. I think that Meta should have tried to create some other platform,0
"Wait for tablet ui ☕🗿 -Remove share via direct in browser(I know, It's use Instagram based)",1
I don't want to have an Instagram account in order to use this.,0
Love you too 💓😘 you,2
Not as good as twitter,0
Knockoff Twitter. You get censored if you post anything that goes against the narrative. Garbage app.,0
"Loving the new Threads app by Instagram! I have to say, Instagram has really outdone themselves with this one. Threads is a fantastic addition to the Instagram family, and it's quickly becoming my go-to app for connecting with friends.",1
What's the point of following accounts if the feed is just randomized content from people I don't follow?,0
Yet one more stolen conceptby criminal Zuckerberg that is all hype and no content or value. Immediatey uses your private data without asking. Uninstalled trash,0
👍,2
Why can’t I edit my own posts!!?!?!,1
Better than Twitter. Threads👌,2
First to get zucced,2
So far so good breath of fresh air,2
Nice app. I didn't see many features yet and didn't see an option to add few accounts. It didn't get all my accounts from IG,1
"The feed was slick and easy to read, though for now it was populated largely with accounts I did not yet follow or care about – perhaps an issue that will resolve itself as more people sign up. ....",2
Very good 🥀🇦🇫👑,2

Won't be using it until there's an option for a feed that only show who I follow.,1

basically a rip off of twitter,0
"Need to fix the bugs on the app. Can't load my profile, can't make a post, can't refresh my page. Also, maybe consider allowing users to download media straight from the timeline",1

Don't install it and link it with you Instagram,0
"First and foremost, the fact that I cannot delete my account is completely unacceptable. As a user, I should have the right to control my online presence and decide whether I want to continue using the app or not. However, this app has taken away that freedom, leaving me feeling trapped and powerless.",0
"The entire app feels like a corporate knock-off of Twitter. Nothing about it is new, except the astroturf and corporate feel of the content.",0
Why does this app exist?,0
This is amazing 😍,2
Nice app but Twitter is better than thread 👍👍👍,2
I am happy with the competition in the market because what always benefits the customers,2
Is a very good app download it and confirm what am saying,1
Keeps on crashing.,0

Op app 😍😍,2
Best,2
Wonderful,2
"Works fine. Everything's so smooth, please don't ruin the experience by adding unnecessary features, only implement the important ones. Don't make it laggy amd choppy like Instagram.",1
It's pretty simple and user friendly but it takes back to insta for some settings. I think that's a bit annoying.,1
How do i get my thread badge? I just joined the thread apo but my badge isn't on my profile,1
This is good though,1
Love you,2
Yessir goated app,2
I like it so far. It would be nice to have drafts and the ability to deactivate our accounts without deleting our Instagram profile. Edit: Also please separate the people we are following and posts from suggested people because it is quite annoying.,1
This is likely the most overhyped program in the history of forever. The news feed desperately needs filters and there's just not a lot of organization or structure to it. It's basically just a reformatted version of Facebook.,0
great app needs some updates,2
"Installed it thinking this time it would be different but it's way more unorganised than any other app. It's like everyone coming up, dumping on thread, need an update where we can see what we want, I don't know where our preference went, like they asked initially but it doesn't seem like they are even using it.",0
Very bad 😡😡😡,2
"More features : like a listening to.., maybe voice note, keep no DM, no Following to count, an edit threads, a translator, no ads please",1

"So disappointed but not surprised. Spent my first 2 weeks on Threads muting irrelevant influencers, celebrities, and companies. I just want to see authentic content from the people I actually follow. Not random “verified” accounts. 

Threads had so much potential to be better than Twitter but Meta is too busy manipulating the algorithm as usual. 

Just deleted the Threads app from my phone, so tired of wasting time on these apps anyways.",0
"It's a great start! I do feel like when adding photos we should have the ability to choose what album we pick from bc I have a ton of images on my phone and scrolling to hunt for them in 10k images isn't fun. Also I feel like there should be in app DMs as that's part of what makes things like Twitter so usable the ability to talk to our friends about threads or post. To what I DO love is the ability to add more than four photos at a time, the ability to write long multi post threads.",1
The app glitches a lot.. Im not able use it because of the glitches.. They ssrly need to work on it,0
Nice,2
Useless and pointless,0
This app has so much glitch. I can't even see a single post clearly . It's so annoying,0
twiter copy paste,0
"Impossible to use. It gets loaded with pics and text layered on each other infinite number of times and my whole screen turns into a mess. Guess it is not optimized or something. This is the only app that gives me such an issue, and Instagram itself works fine.",0

"When i upload the attached media (picture) with the selection from gallery use the share button, when the threads's page appear, the picture i selected doing image rotation by itself. What happens?",0
I only put 5 stars so you could see don’t download this app because once you try to delete it it will delete your instagram too so there’s no way of getting rid of this app and if you try to deactivate it then delete the app itself it still stays on your instagram and won’t remove,2
Not good.,0
Amazing 😁,2
"If you post in Threads app, there is no Edit option for the post.",0
So happy we have a legitimate Twitter alternative now. Elon Musk ruined what was once a great app and is now just a white supremacist wasteland. Don’t have to worry about reading too many tweets with Threads. Was waiting for Bluesky but I’m going to stick with threads at this point. Bluesky playing too many games.,2

I am disappointed for your threads app your app is after the download then I enter your app the app flickering and a page is like disconnected cable connection problem🤣🥴. So to solve the problem,0

i think you should add features such as for you page (fyp) and following. it's a little boring scrolling and seeing random people's posts. i just hope you'll add those features because it'd be a nice experience especially for me.,0

"The new Threads app shows great potential in the social media landscape with its user-friendly interface and emphasis on visual storytelling. However, one suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate an algorithm-based approach like TikTok, giving everyone a fair chance at going viral, unlike the limited exposure on platforms such as Twitter.",2

"I'm rooting for a Twitter replacement but threads it not it so far. The extreme connection to Instagram is really annoying. I want them to be separate, I don't want every change I make to have to reflect on both apps. I want separate usernames and pfps and I want it to not open Instagram every single time I want to change the smallest setting. 
It also desperately needs a ""people you follow"" timeline. It took only a few days for my ENTIRE feed to be absolutely zero people I follow and exclusively celebrities, brands, and influencers so until they implement a timeline change, the app is completely pointless and not really usable unless I want to spend several hours being nonstop advertised to. This could possibly work and take a lot of traffic away from Twitter as it descends into a bigoted trash heap but it needs an insane amount of work. Less hardcore connection to Instagram and better feeds. Otherwise it's just going to flounder for a while and eventually die as we all move back to Twitter or tumblr.",1

"I’m hoping this can be a permanent replacement for Twitter. Main points of annoyance:
 - Whenever I open the app, rather than letting me start from where I was it jumps up to a random point in the feed 
 - Badly needs following-only chronological feed
 - Recommendations are random, like influencers I wouldn’t care about, vs driven by the people I follow 
 - No desktop version",1

We don't all have time to browse content of a random FEED for POSTs made by those we choose to FOLLOW.",1
Please separate timeline by two categories which are FYP and following only (with some filters like show latest thread or show trending). Add a Direct Messages too so people can feel more connected each other. The last thing is create a mark on people who following each other so we can track someone who doesn't follow back or someone who just unfollowed us. Thanks.,2

"this app has an amazing feel , i really enjoy the layout it has , just generally how things are set up . but , there are many things i think should be added to updates further down the road . first off , theres no trending page . one of the things that was very useful to most people on twitter was the trending page , which is now replaced with a ""who to follow"" section , which shows up on your timeline as well . also , no dms !!! i get that its an instagram app , but i hate having to go back and forth between apps just to message someone . another issue i have is how you cannot set up and an account without having instagram , and how you cannot delete your threads account without deleting your instagram account . like i said , i understand that its connected , but itd feel a little more freeing , i guess , having the accounts be separate , or at LEAST being able to change your name/username without going into the instagram app . ALSOO , i hate how your timeline isnt , or is at least very hard to get , tailored to you . ive followed many , many people , and still get random people or celebrities ive never heard of popping up on my feed , with jokes or sayings i have no interest in . maybe its because the app is new , but i feel like a lot of other apps have adapted a lot quicker . despite these downsides though , i think the app is great . for what it has already , i havent noticed any actual issues with using it . no bugs or anything .",1

"Warning. This app is sneaky. 

Also makes you think friends intentionally are waiting to add you as friend requests but it’s bc it’s so easy to answer yes to sending an invite to all your existing IG requests. It words it in a sneaky way to make you give it permission. Careful. 

And it advertised itself as a “messaging” app in an IG ad. I thought it was like Messenger for FB. Tricky. 

Also no clear benefit over Twitter.",0

"At first look, I can’t see using this app. My feed shows a ton of content from people I don’t know and don’t follow. I joined out of curiosity and frustration with Instagram, where the algorithm blocks a lot of content I want to see. It also offers posts days after they were posted and I miss events that way. I want Instagram to show me all posts by users I follow and in the order posted, not according to some imaginary idea of what an algorithm thinks I want to see. I would ask the same from Threads.",0
"Very vest of time application, worst experience, copy of Twitter, threads is a Twitter little brother, I deleted threads and all so Instagram, and Instagram like a tik tok 2.0 version, and really rate of both app 100/-1 they are deserving this rate.",0
This app has some amazing features far more better than twitter,2
"Needs more functionality to compete with other social platforms like direct messaging and searching for anything other than accounts. Currently, the app is down for many people and there is no logic to why it went down. That is surprising and disappointing for such a big corporation already rooted in social media like Meta.",1

So far the app is great. Easy to use.,2
Bad !!!! As hell. I will say that it can't delete the thread account... You have created instead it will delete your Instagram account too..! You can't delete them separately. You can't text anyone on threads. Wrist feature of thread is the deleting account. Mobs who are looking for thread do not install or create a account or it will ruin both of acc insta and threads's account. I regret getting thread. I think here I will disconnect with Instagram or threads.,0
I understand this is new but when I try to post my picture app get crashed i think you don't want normal people to post publicly you are promoting your own people,0
Que dura el app creo que mejor que Twitter 😅,2

"It needs recommended content in the discover area, it’s just a search bar for people. It does not allow to search keywords or use hashtags. 

It needs a popular topics area, like the 
Trending area, it only 1 feed (similar to Instagram’s feed)

It’s not a separate app like Facebook it’s to Instagram, it’s an extension of Instagram in a separate app.

At the moment, Twitter still the better options unless you are famous with a lot of followers.",0

What is this?? If i don't have an Instagram account i can not login to Threads?? Why??? Just accept that we need a less toxic app than insta that's the reason we stayed on twt all this time. And now Threads won't let you login without insta account?? Thats not at all fair,0
the app has been glitching ever since i installed it i cant see or read anything or use the app in any way,0

If you launch this app to compete the twitter then need to work hard ... After spending 30 minutes I found this app boring from logo to interface ... Near to me this app is only for gathering info nothing else ... This is a new way to find People's at one forum ... Twitter is far away from Threads ... Threads logo has threatening feels ... Scary 😳,0
Better than Twitter I would say.,2

mutuals, and posts about my interests!! ive seen people request a dm option, but i dont mind how it is now. what i would love, however, is a trending page, and the ability to search words to find posts. overall, i do like it, but it needs some things added",1

You can’t delete it with out deleting Instagram account. You can’t create an account with out an Instagram account. A lot of features look the same of other apps. Plus zuck collecting data of you on all his media platforms and selling without your knowledge.,0

"Not sure if the warm fuzzy new platform feeling will last forever (or once meta finds a way to monetize with ads), but right now Threads is super fun and has been making me enjoy social media for the first time in a while. I appreciate threads’ moderate approach to moderation - add disclaimers to fake news / fake news posters while also not outright censoring people. Elon musk lovers are mad, but they really should just be worried since this will definitely kill twitter. The UI is slick and the features work so far. My one request would be to add a “close friends” posts features so that not all my insta friends following me on threads see EVERYTHING.",2

"wanna try this out but i dont want to create instagram account, turned out i cant. uninstalled",0
My app is not working properly 😩 Can someone please help me,0
There’s no option to toggle cellular data off/on in settings of the app. This seems like a violation of the App Store and my “rights” as a user of your app. Fix it,0

"Anything apart from twitter, I am good.",2
"Instagram clearly seems to be taking a shot at twitter here and i havent read one review that didnt mention how someone hated twitter or twitter was garbage now. 

so honest review WITHOUT BIAS;

this is a fad and is going to fizzle out rather quickly, there is nothing special or unique about this app and it essentially seems to be just an extention of instagram with a much worse algorithm. The feed is not really tailored to you so much as its just whats popular. It connects fully with the meta ecosystem which causes privacy concerns for me; (id also like my accounts to be separate but connected for once). it seems like they released a beta version or something because this cant be a finished product",0
"What a great Application THREADS 🌺

Although , the most and the best applications in Iran need to vpn 😞😞 

It is very useful and easy to use, I love this so much 💐❤️

This is not installed my phone please help us,2
A review from July 2023.,1
"Great, but bring random video chat feature here, that will be super fun 🤣",2
Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread 🧵. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future 😔 yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ✨,0
Great!,2
Nice Interface With Information,1

Migration was supposed to be the great thing. I had to go find most of the people I follow. Notifications don't work even though they are turned on to the people I want to hear from. This is a rushed app. Not original. Feels like a partially completed term paper. Not impressed,0

Twitter ripoff.,0
Twitter is a place where you can post your thoughts and feelings uncensored. Threads is extremely censored much like everything else meta produces.,0
Well that was fast.  Censorship out the gate with the obvious data mining that comes with Meta.  75% drop in usage the very first week.,0
I love this app,2

Update: no basic features even after month of launching, and glitches and slowness is still same, can't upload anything because it ends up in the limbo, no wonder why this app is losing the game against twitter.",0
Waste of time to use 👎👎👎,0
"Currently there is not any web interface option for computers, which is a HUGE issue for me (as well as for many others in my industry). I only access the competition (Twitter) via web browsers on my computer. I follow businesses and services in my industry during work (multi monitors in common place in my industry). No interest in following from my phone's little 6.8"" screen. Thanks for reading",1

Good application nice work by Instagram 😄👍,2
Update: Finally the issue have been resolved. It is running smoothly. Firstly from Day 1 the app is glitchy with overlapped posts and dragged screens. I haven't seen the actual interface till now. Secondly now it says that my instagram account will be deleted if I delete Threads. That's totally unfair. On one hand I can't use Threads and on the other hand I can't delete it. So I am left with last option of uninstalling it. I was so excited at first but now I am totally disappointed.,1
Elon is not happy now 🥲,2

these are such basic features for a social media app to have, and you’d think instagram (and facebook) of all platforms would know the bare minimum of what to add to a twitter-like app.",1
WOW,1
"I'm a US resident, but I was in Europe when Threads launched. it seems to have marked me as an EU resident and it's keeping me from accessing my profile, notifications, and content Despite my Instagram account having an ad account with a US phone number and address as proof. I have three Instagram accounts (business, personal, and niche hobby) with none of the linked Thread accounts accessible. I've cleared the cache, deleted and reinstalled the app, deleted the app, restarted my phone, and then reinstalled. Nothing works. I've tried contacting IG support, but I know from past experience that they won't get back to me, so maybe a review of the app will. Believe me, I'd rather be on that than on Twitter.",0

"There is no search function, so it's impossible to find info by topic. There is no chronological feed, so it's impossible to find very recent news.

"Yet ANOTHER app by Meta in an attempt to be the only folks who run social media, which wouldn’t be so bad if they actually did it well. Reach on ALL their platforms has gone so incredibly downhill that I’m ready to ditch social media entirely for my business and get creative doing my own thing. They treat all artists like their UNPAID content creators and even if you are just starting out and have a small following they limit your reach of your posts don’t perform to their standards. It’s like being in high school all over again. I hate being bullied into posting what they want and when they want and how they want or else no one will see my posts ever. I’m so ready for something better and not owned by Meta.",0

Another way for meta to track you. That's it. They saw a gap forming in the industry and decided to take more for themselves. Meta very nearly has a monopoly on social media and is known to nab everything from your device they can just to sell for profit to unknown parties.,0

Just another replicated version of Twitter and Instagram. Didn't find the app really exciting or anything new Plus seems the competition was only to prove who has fastest account holder which mera have achieved successfully offcourse by their marketing strategy through Instagram. Else won't recommend the app to anyone Just another TIME WASTING MACHINE which forces you to retain your account and cannot be deleted willingly. #privacyconcern,0

Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.,1

"I am a big fan of this application. I've been getting tired of all the changes Elon has done to twitter. There is still a very steep growth curve, but im very excited. There are two features that I feel like would be really helpful to improve user experience. 1) as im writing my threads, if I exceed the number of threads my screen allows, I am unable to scroll down to see what im writing as my keyboard is blocking the view, and threads doesn't allow to scroll down. 2) threads scheduler!",1

Super app,2
"Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.",0

This app is a great throw back to old school Twitter. Highly recommend this over Twitter now. The algorithm shows you things you want to see versus Twitter which shows you paid users first.

It's working fine but there are a lot of features that needs to be improved. One most important I would like to mention is that deleting Threads account should not affect Instagram account at all. This is a very big disadvantage that needs to be improved ASAP.I mean DELETING & not deactivating.,1
App feels seamless!!!,2
New threads by Instagram.,1
Very Good Mark,2
For now I give it 2 stars since the app interface just acting weirdly. Looks like the screen is gllitching all the time whenever I tried to scroll. Maybe because it's quite new app. Hopefully it got fixed soon. It's annoying to not be able to do anything.,0

"This app wants access to so much about you, it’s almost certain a year in there will be a news story about how it scraped your bank account number, and recorded everything you’ve said since you downloaded it. 

All that, so you can get access to a place where only government, media, elites, and brands will be promoted, while you realize you joined an echo chamber of group-think that despises ideas or criticism of anything that goes against the cult.

"I love it, Better than others",2
deactivated my threads acc but still the link is showing on my instagram account. it is literally forcing me to download the app again. never download this stupid boring app!!,0
Good social site,2
Just a Facebook version of Twitter with more censorship.,0
"This was released way before it’s time. They should have figured out the basics. No hashtags, no search for anything other than usernames, poor interoperability between Meta platforms of any, immediately put limits but never posted or published expectations, good active threaders being put in timeout or banned due to being excited and active, no way to communicate with AI to explain your case of not being a script. Head of Instagram acknowledged that unintentional restrictions would be put on active users with good intentions with no way of getting ahold of the company. You see so much crap, and you have no control of your feed. When you unfollow people you will see the egregious content anyway. Profile is weak, text characters is too limited, no way to know if those you follow and following you. No edit button, slow & unresponsive, the list goes on…",0
Good App,2
Interesting ☺️,2
Excellent,2
Varry nice app🥰🥰,2
Competitor of Twitter,2
Better than Twitter it's very smooth ❤️,2

Ayo I love Twitter! So much I downloaded it again,2
I like the idea. But the app keeps crashing and it's incredibly buggy. Please fix it,0
Adding a share option to a single person (DM) would be great,2
It takes a lot time while installing... Reach of the posts is not so good...,1
A combination of ig and twitter nice but need translations for every language for better interactions.,1

"Do not download Threads. You will never ever be able to delete it, unless you delete your Instagram. That is 1000% messed up. Now I'm locked in a 360 deal with an app smh. I didn't want to sign-up, I was just checking it out. Now in stuck with it. So sad smh. The things they do. You can only deactivate. But what if I just don't want it. Why y'all do society like that? Have a heart, let us go if we feel like it.",0
Hello developers i am not a user of instagram but want to use a threads please allow section for new signups rather than just login from instagram if its there then please make it more visible because I am not able to reach there,1
No Trending Section! Like . seriously??,0
It's just a revamped Twitter. Nothing new. Boring 😴,1

"same algorithms, same content so nothing new. when all meta use same algorithms across their social media what's the point of adding another.",0

"It could be a good app if it's feed was better. It shows more people I don't follow than I follow with no way to filter it. The last time I opened the app, it showed a rather profane post from an account I do not follow. So I deleted the app. I like regular Instagram a whole lot better.",0
It's okay now,1

Good app so far I wish there was an option to translate and also the ability to dm .,1

One sentence Review 🙌 we are done with twitter,2
"Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.",0
Awesome app!,2
"Doesn't work, freezes on home screen",0
Similar to twitter if not slightly better. However i wish they had a hashtag interface so your not just seeing accounts but actual posts in the search menu.,1

Well Great Execution may be a copy 2 Twitter but looks quite intresting... Of course some developments yet 2 b done like - 1) Increase d word limit in bio coloumn 2) It takes lot of time 2 post any thread 3) Multiple options in COLOUR & FONT makes more attractive,2

"Content loading needs work, otherwise a stable smooth app.",1
"Firstly a playback system, maybe if I double tap the right side of the screen it plays forward a few seconds and vise versa, a media only section to where we can only see videos and picture, ofc with the option of being able to pick which one we wanna see only which in fact twitter DOESNT have, and maybe also like a page that’s called stuff you like, that’s based off your follows and likes, like a for you page, but with a different name. Actually maybe it can be called THREADED I kinda like the sound of that honestly. Tho even if you didn’t add these things the app is already really good, I’m pretty you guys won’t F this up. GOOD JOB DEVELOPMENT TEAM",2
Very good,2
This Is Nice Platform 👌 👍 better than twitter,2
"Teething problems as expected, on android need option to be able save photos. And be able to zoom in pictures and stayed zoomed in rather than keeping hold of pic. Also be able to search threads, when you currently search just the profiles come up and not the threads",1
Can’t even use it because it glitches,0
The Zuckerberg couldn’t afford Twitter so he main a skeleton copy of it and it isn’t very good and already heavily censors users.,0
"I don’t care for threads, remove the badge from the profile! I don’t want to use the app anymore",0
Shows following once and then immediately switches to complete strangers. Worse than twitter,0
Use twitter,0
Threads still needs improvement to competition with Twitter. Hashtag and DM should also be supported.,1

Is it better than twitter ?,1
"It's moderated Twitter as opposed to 4chan esque current Twitter that is nearly impossible to check in public because it's become overrun by hate and bots for a particular blue and white website. DMs coming soon. Users concerned about privacy; if the app is free, you are the product. There isn't anything on this app that is going to know any more about you than the little tracking/gps/algorithm driven device you carry in your pocket everyday already knows.",2

"For a competitor of Twitter, it’s missing a couple of key things which I enjoyed from the site such as translations, filtering through who you’re following, and the atmosphere is simply just not the same as the site on Twitter.
